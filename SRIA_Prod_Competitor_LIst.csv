TaxCloud automatically keeps track of how things are taxed differently across all the states, automatically recognizes sales tax holidays, integrates easily with shopping carts and ordering systems, and helps online retailers instantly calculate, collect and remit sales tax. 

With TaxCloud, even the smallest of businesses can easily manage sales tax in one state or all states - at no cost.  Perhaps more important than the free price tag, is the fact that TaxCloud has already been certified by many the states, which provides the retailers significantly reduced compliance risk (via indemnification, limitation of liability, and audit relief). In such an environment businesses need a trusted and stable compliance partner capable of easily handling their current obligations, but also a solution that can scale to handle any additional obligations they may have in the future.

TaxCloud is trusted by more than 26,000 online retailers every day (and adding more every day).

Our mission and message is simple: We believe no retailer should have to pay to comply with sales tax obligations because most jurisdictions are eager to ensure their sales taxes are collected correctly and remitted timely.

By shifting the efforts of compliance back upon the states, TaxCloud has inverted the traditional tax technology marketplace, making sales tax compliance easy (and even free) for retailers of any size.

Their mission has always been to help their customers achieve what matters most to them.

In 1993, they shipped their first data storage system to Patrick Mulrooney, who at that time was a system administrator at Tandem Computers. The network appliance was designed to clean up his infrastructure sprawl. He loved its simplicity.

“Patrick’s favorite attribute was that their system rebooted in 30 seconds instead of hours like their competitors,” says NetApp co-founder, Dave Hitz. “While solving his downtime problem, they also gave Patrick a competitive edge.”

More than 20 years later, their story is still about delivering innovation that gives their customers an edge over their competitors. From the edge of the universe with CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, to the edge of human endurance in Formula One auto racing, they help you do things you couldn’t before—at speeds you never thought possible.

Throughout the world, leading organizations count on NetApp for software, systems, and services to manage and store their data. They help enterprises and service providers envision, deploy, and evolve their IT environments. Customers also benefit from their open collaboration with other technology leaders to create the specific solutions they need. 

their team is passionate about customer success. Their company culture and work environment support that dedication. Together with their global network of partners, they are united in one goal: to help their customers achieve the outcomes that matter most to them.


They view their culture as a competitive advantage and a foundation for continued success. They proudly hire the world’s most talented and committed employees, who work hard to help their customers, partners, shareholders, and communities thrive.

Their commitment to their values results in an award-winning culture of collaboration and trust. The Great Place to Work Institute recently named NetApp #4 on its "World's Best Multinational Workplaces 2015" - the world's first annual study of multinational workplace excellence. They have repeatedly earned a spot on FORTUNE magazine's list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" in the United States, as well as top spots on "Great Place to Work" lists in locations around the world.

Their operational philosophy and culture are defined by their commitment to delivering the best possible results for the communities they serve. At NetApp, they take pride in living a set of shared core values: trust and integrity, leadership, simplicity, adaptability, teamwork and synergy, go beyond, get things done.

Since their beginning in 1992, they have been delivering technology and product firsts with one goal in mind: the success of their customers. They continually push the boundaries of what’s possible to provide efficient and flexible IT, so their customers’ budgets can go further and business can go faster. They have repeatedly set the industry standard with game-changing innovations that have the power to transform business.",743,"2020-07-10 04:46:11","2021-01-20 08:52:59","Network Appliance Inc.",netapp,http://www.facebook.com/NetApp,http://www.linkedin.com/company/netapp,http://twitter.com/netapp,NTAP,http://netapp.com,"["Hardware", "Information Technology", "Internet Services", "Software"]",Sunnyvale,California,"United States",USA,Crunchbase,"["Cloud Computing", "Data Storage", "Information Technology"]",743,1

In 2007 it was the only bank in the United States to be rated AAA by S&P, though its rating has since been lowered to AA− in light of the financial crisis of 2007–2012. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.

To address the growing challenges in software development and the increasing demands of clients looking to enhance quality levels, they have been looking for new opportunities and methods to enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of apps, websites, etc.

Thanks to an increasingly digitalised world, crowdsourcing, which is the sourcing of tasks to a global online community, has found its place in the business world and especially the IT industry. The application of this new form of labour to software testing resulted in a new, innovative method known as crowdtesting.

A major benefit of crowdtesting is the opportunity to have not only experts but also unbiased consumers performing software tests on their own devices and under real world conditions. This grants access to a nearly endless combination of devices, operating systems and software. Another advantage of this method lies in the selection of testers, who can be chosen based on numerous criteria and characteristics that reflect the product’s target group. Crowdtesters are available ad-hoc via the internet and ready to search for defects and usability issues without encountering operational blindness. As a result, businesses are provided with a huge amount of flexibility in allocating their resources.

They were able to quickly convince their first clients and investors about the numerous benefits and opportunities of crowdtesting. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology (now Economy and Energy) recognised their business model’s potential and funded Testbirds in the form of the EXIST scholarship as well as the start-up competition, “IKT Innovativ”.",NULL,"2020-07-10 04:46:11","2021-01-20 09:06:36","Testbirds GmbH",testbirds,http://www.facebook.com/Testbirds,https://www.linkedin.com/company/testbirds/,https://twitter.com/testbirds,NULL,https://www.testbirds.de/,"["Apps", "Information Technology", "Mobile", "Software"]",München,Bayern,Germany,DEU,Crunchbase,"["Enterprise Software", "Information Services", "Information Technology", "Mobile Apps", "Software"]",2096,1

ESI used in connection with eDiscovery includes email, word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and other office files, social media and other web pages, computer databases, and virtually anything that can be stored on a computer and can be read only through the use of computers.  This data is the critical evidence used by attorneys in modern commercial litigation.

Lexbe offers customers licensed use of the Lexbe eDiscovery Platform (LEP), which is cloud/SaaS-based eDiscovery software.  LEP features and functionality include electronically stored information DIY upload/ingestion, electronic file archive extraction, metadata extraction and fielding, processing, OCR of image files, text extraction of native files, search index construction and maintenance, search interface and saved searches, hard-coded and custom created coding fields, standard and customized reports, automatic and custom privilege log creation, PII and other confidential/proprietary information identification and coding, redaction editing, transcript management, legal fact & issues/chronology construction, briefcases, legal productions and other exports, end-to-end encryption and other security protocols, and prepopulated and custom litigation workflows.

Lexbe’s market is boutique law firms and boutique practice areas in larger law firms (“Boutique Law”). Boutique Law customers usually prefer a DIY on-demand eDiscovery software solution, to allow law firm staff to handle most eDiscovery matters in-house themselves.  We believe that the Boutique Law market is growing at an above-average rate in the legal vertical and demands new innovative solutions to legal discovery.

The History Behind LocationSmart 

Originally, LocationSmart was founded under the name of TechnoCom Corporation in 1995. Its initial goal was to help wireless carriers with their mobile location requirements. Because of its innovative products and services, Deloitte chose TechnoCom as one of the top 50 fastest growing tech companies in Los Angeles for four years in a row. 

In October 2010, LocationSmart was developed as a division of TechnoCom Corporation. Since it was initially founded, LocationSmart has worked to help people and businesses around the world with location-based services. This company currently has the largest American footprint of any business for location-based services. To make user adoption even easier, the company has pioneered innovative methods for gaining privacy consent. 

Today, LocationSmart is ranked as the best location-as-a-service provider in the world. Their services are included on 15 billion devices around the world. Every single type of device in the world has the capacity to use LocationSmart, and their technology has been used at least once on every device type before.

What Can LocationSmart Do? 

LocationSmart offers a powerful platform for location determination that is designed to be cloud-based. This trusted service helps to raise an organization's business intelligence by delivering additional data, improving the company's operational efficiencies and lowering overall costs. LocationSmart's location-as-a-service platform also helps companies improve their customer engagement and security. It can be used with IP addresses, carriers, landlines and device SDK. 

Businesses can also use options like LocationSmart's device profile and messaging services. The messaging option allows companies to create geo-enabled SMS, in-app messages and standalone campaigns. The two-way messaging involves complete SMS management that works with more than 60 different carriers. Meanwhile, the device profile option uses the cloud to conduct real-time identity verification and device verification. Because of this, the device profile can help companies validate their returning customers and halt cybercriminals. This technique uses real-time risk scoring and behavior analytics to determine which devices and consumers carry the biggest risk for a company's security. 

With the geofencing and privacy features, businesses can ensure their clients' privacy and create geo-relevant campaigns. Geofencing helps companies create a radius for providing ads and other services. With LocationSmart's privacy features, businesses can include consent controls and reminders for their users.

1192,254,"Bounty Jobs",RecruitiFi,"RecruitiFi has created a unique new category of recruiting known as the Expert Referral System (ERS), which allows companies to leverage a crowd of expert recruiters in a targeted and confidential manner. A growing number of Fortune 500 companies are utilizing RecruitiFi's ERS platform to quickly fill their open positions with vetted, qualified talent. As an added benefit, the Expert Referral System streamlines agency interaction, allowing employers to manage their existing suppliers, vet new agencies, and utilize RecruitiFi's crowd of proven, expert recruiters at a low, flat placement fee. 

How does it work for Employers? 
Employers invite their current recruiting agencies to work at their existing fees, while leveraging RecruitiFi’s community at one low, flat fee. Recruiters are then scored in real time as employers view, sort, disposition, and hire their candidates. This allows the platform’s algorithms to match future jobs to a subset of qualified recruiters based on their performance on similar searches. The ERS eliminates the need to review recruiters based on anecdotal observations, automatically vetting new agencies and managing existing recruiters based on real data. It’s quick, confidential, easy, and taps into new pools of talent, resulting in higher quality candidates and a reduced time-to-hire. 

How does it work for Recruiters? 
Using a recruiter’s preferred industries, roles, and locations, the algorithm provides closely matching job requisitions (JobCasts). RecruitiFi actively vets all JobCasts, ensuring they have an active hiring need and do not have candidates in process. Additionally, the ERS platform requires detailed employer feedback, while RecruitiFi’s account managers provide a direct line of contact, eliminating the notorious "Resume Black Hole." The result: more transparency and more placement fees. Recruiters also enjoy a unique payment model that awards cash bonuses for quality candidates—even if they don't ultimately get hired!",NULL,"2020-07-10 04:46:11","2021-11-01 00:13:17",NULL,recruitifi,http://www.facebook.com/recruitifi,http://www.linkedin.com/company/recruitifi,http://twitter.com/RecruitiFi,NULL,https://www.recruitifi.com,"["Administrative Services", "Other", "Professional Services", "Software"]","New York","New York","United States",USA,Crunchbase,"["Crowdsourcing", "Human Resources", "Recruiting", "Software"]",2624,1

1826,540,FORGEROCK,OneLogin,"The proliferation of digital access has made the world more connected than ever before. Trust is the common thread that connects today’s elastic enterprise--trust that your identity solution will be there when you need it most and trust that your end-users know their information is safe. 

The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform is the identity foundation to build secure, scalable and smart trusted experiences that connect people with technology. With OneLogin, seamlessly manage digital identities for your workforce and customers, so you can focus on what matters most--growing your business. 

With OneLogin’s complete solution, you can easily connect all of your applications, leverage our proprietary machine learning to identify and analyze potential threats and act quickly using contextual authentication requirements.

Secure: Security is the cornerstone of trust. It’s the confidence that your identity solution is reliable and always-on, so you can focus on what matters--growing the business. The OneLogin platform protects your organization against threats by securing and centralizing your applications, devices, and end-users all in one, easy-to-access place. Additionally, through our advanced machine learning capabilities, OneLogin can deliver real-time threat intelligence to help automate the process of keeping your business secure. 

Scalable: The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform was built for performance and reliability at scale. With a wide breadth of extensible functionality, we can expand and retract according to the changing needs of your business. Through our enterprise-grade change management solutions, like our Enterprise Sandbox and API Access, you can quickly test large-scale changes before going live in your production instance. Our high availability Login Clusters elastically load-balance providing reliable, continuous service when you need it the most. That means if your database is impacted for any reason, your OneLogin environment won’t be impacted.  

Smart: The risk of cyberattacks continue to increase as perpetrators look for smarter and less-detectable ways to circumvent security solutions. And for today’s businesses, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to implement solutions that evolve as the methods of attackers evolve. Although Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has become the defacto tool to protect end-user credentials and your business’ sensitive data, static authentication simply isn’t enough. Additionally, as identity management solutions seek to find more ways to secure the enterprise, user experience is often sacrificed, causing end-users to become increasingly agitated, often seeking out ways to evade having to authenticate several times. 

Simple: Ease-of-use and speed-of-adoption are imperative to ensuring your identity and access management strategy is effectively rolled out across your organization. And in order to achieve that the solution you choose must be simple. And that means simple for you and simple for your users. 

OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Citizen, Evernote, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Stitch Fix, and Uber.

Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 6,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits *Developer toolkits & APIs

DIFFERENTIATORS:

Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include:

OneLogin Access: OneLogin Access extends the reach of the OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform™ to applications hosted on-premises and in public or private clouds. We bring the benefits of the cloud to you: simplified administration reduced IT costs, improved security, and enhanced user experience. OneLogin Access eliminates aging Access Management tools that are complex, expensive, and disconnected from modern SaaS environments. Through the OneLogin portal, users enjoy a simple, consistent experience with single-click access to SaaS and on-premise applications from any device.

OneLogin SmartFactor AuthenticationTM: As part of our Trusted Experience Platform™, SmartFactor Authentication leverages our Vigilance AI™ risk score to dynamically adjust authentication requirements in real-time based on the level of risk for each login, balancing security with usability. OneLogin’s SmartFactor Authentication uses machine learning to analyze a broad range of inputs, such as location, device, and user behavior, to calculate a risk score and determine the most appropriate security action to take for each login attempt. Depending on the detected level of risk, SmartFactor Authentication adjusts the number of authentication factors needed to log in.

OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again.

OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time.

OneLogin Cloud RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Merakiwireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short.

ACQUISITIONS: 

In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor.

In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises.

RECOGNITION:

In November 2019, OneLogin was named a 2019 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Access Management Software.

In September 2019, OneLogin was recognized in the G2 Grid as one of the top four leaders for Single Sign-On (SSO) software.

In June 2019, OneLogin achieved a strong performer ranking for identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) in “The Forrester Wave™: Identity-As-A-Service (IDaaS) For Enterprise, Q2 2019.”

In April 2019, OneLogin was named the 2019 G2 Leader and Top Performer in the following categories: Privileged Access Management Single Sign On (SSO) Customer Identity and Access Management User Provisioning/Governance.

The company offers a comprehensive and proven identity management solution to help organisations protect their customer and partner’s digital identity data. As well as managing risk against breaches, using Ubisecure greatly improves how users register, engage and use the organisation’s application, whether it’s a web, mobile or a legacy service. 

When making build vs buy decisions, using Ubisecure is less risky than building identity management functionality in-house.

Over the past five years advancements in technology have continued to push the envelope, often taking conventional wisdom by surprise when the impossible becomes reality. During this same time period the popularity of foreign exchange trading has been running a nearly parallel, upward course. The vision of Boston Technologies is to harness the expansion of these two rapidly growing sectors of the economy and take them to the next level.

This bridge is simply one of the many software solutions Boston Technologies hopes will redefine the trading industry.

1. Client Focus

2545,746,NetSpend,"Green Dot","Green Dot Corporation is a provider of retail-based financial services.

The company offers consumers financial products and services through  retailer locations including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, Rite Aid, Kmart, Kroger, 7-ELEVEN, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Smiths and Radio Shack.

Green Dot's products include Green Dot MasterCard® and Visa® branded prepaid debit cards and the Green Dot MoneyPak® - a cash processing gateway that provides a way for consumers to load cash to prepaid cards, use cash to make purchases and pay bills, and add cash to a variety of accounts including PayPal. 

Green Dot is a leading prepaid financial services company providing simple, low-cost and convenient money management solutions to a broad base of U.S. consumers. They believe that they are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States and that their Green Dot Network is the leading prepaid reload network in the United States. They sell their cards and offer their reload services nationwide at approximately 50,000 retail store locations, which provide consumers convenient access to their products and services. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, provides essential functionality, including point-of-sale connectivity and interoperability with Visa, MasterCard and other payment or funds transfer networks, and compliance and other capabilities to their Green Dot Network, enabling real-time transactions in a secure environment. The combination of their innovative products, broad retail distribution and proprietary technology creates powerful network effects, which they believe enhance the value they deliver to their customers, retail distributors and other participants in their network.
 
They were an early pioneer in the development of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, or GPR cards, and associated reload services, which collectively they refer to as prepaid financial services. GPR cards are designed for general spending purposes and can be used anywhere the cards' applicable payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, is accepted, but, unlike gift cards, can be reloaded with additional funds for ongoing, long-term use. Their GPR cards are issued as Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards and are accepted worldwide by merchants and other businesses belonging to the applicable payment network, including for bill payments, online shopping, everyday store purchases and ATM withdrawals. They believe that they are the leading provider of GPR cards in the United States based on the 3.4 million active cards in their portfolio as of March 31, 2010, which they define as cards that have had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period.
 
They have built strong distribution and marketing relationships with many significant retail chains, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Kroger, K-Mart, Meijer and Radio Shack. These retail chains provide consumers with convenient locations to purchase and reload their cards. In addition, any holder of a GPR card issued by a member of their reload network may reload that card at any one of those locations. Currently, there are over 100 third-party prepaid card programs that use their nationwide reload network to facilitate reloading by their cardholders. In 2009, they entered into an agreement with PayPal whereby its customers can add funds to any new or existing PayPal account through their reload network at all retail locations where they sell their products and services, but to date they have not generated significant operating revenues from their relationship with PayPal. In fiscal 2009, the gross dollar volume loaded to their GPR card and reload products was $4.7 billion, an increase of 67% over fiscal 2008.
 
They have developed a business model with powerful network effects. Growth in the number of their product and service offerings or their network participants, which include consumers, retail distributors and businesses that accept reloads or payments through the Green Dot Network, enhances the value they deliver to all network participants. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, enables network participants to communicate and complete transactions rapidly and securely through their reload network or third-party payment or funds transfer networks, and is a central component of their network-based business model.",NULL,"2020-07-10 04:46:11","2021-01-20 07:44:22","Green Dot Corporation",green-dot-corporation,http://www.facebook.com/GreenDot,https://www.linkedin.com/company/green-dot-corporation,http://twitter.com/greendotcards,GDOT,http://www.greendot.com,"["Financial Services"]",Pasadena,California,"United States",USA,Crunchbase,"["Finance", "Financial Services"]",3912,1

2841,837,"Rapid Ratings",LogicManager,"In their 21st century business environment, everything is connected, and risk is the common link. Misconceptions about the role of risk management, and how to accomplish it effectively, have resulted in countless organizations falling victim to preventable disasters. Preventable, that is, if only those companies had established an effective ERM program.
 
In 2005, LogicManager CEO, Steven Minsky, recognized the opportunity for organizations to adopt a risk based approach. Risk was the driver – the common factor – between all governance functions, so how could embracing it not result in huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and ultimately bottom line value?
 
Building on years of experience in risk and business process management at leading technology firms like Apple, Steven founded LogicManager, and built the LogicManager platform on patent-pending Taxonomy technology; designed to revolutionize how organization’s approached risk management.
 
Since 2005, LogicManager’s risk management platform and mentoring services has provided a foundation for ERM programs to thousands of organizations worldwide. LogicManager’s success is built on three core values: customer satisfaction, risk management expertise, and cost effective innovation.

Their software-as-a-service package is easy to adopt and allows for very quick implementations. Access can be granted in as little as one business day, and full-business implementation takes less than 90 days, guaranteed.  Their multi-tenant structure also fuels improvement; the platform is constantly honed by feedback from customers just like yourself. It’s the users themselves that drive its evolution.

LogicManager’s architecture also facilitates, and even encourages, customization. You can more easily and cheaply customize the tool than you can other hosted cloud or on-premise solutions. In fact, customizations don’t cost anything at all — you’ll never pay beyond your base subscription. Tailor the platform to your needs, no matter how specific. Your business analysts won’t need to go to the development team to write new code, because “customizations” are really configurations. This drastically reduces the likelihood of downtime due to broken code.",NULL,"2020-07-10 04:46:11","2021-01-20 08:14:30",NULL,logicmanager,https://www.facebook.com/LogicManager/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/logicmanager-inc.,https://twitter.com/logicmanager,NULL,http://www.logicmanager.com,"["Financial Services", "Internet Services", "Professional Services", "Software"]",Boston,Massachusetts,"United States",USA,Crunchbase,"["Compliance", "Finance", "Internet", "Risk Management", "Software"]",4194,1

3250,13,"Lending Tree Inc (COAF)",Kabbage,"Kabbage is a financial technology and data company pioneering a new, automated way for small businesses to access working capital. The company simplifies the manual application process to one that is 100% online and automated. Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000.

Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a business’s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle.

The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses – online and brick-and-mortar – in February 2014.

In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones.

Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available.

Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazine’s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbage’s data and technology platform available through MasterCard’s network of acquirers.

In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list. In October 2015, Kabbage completed a Series E funding round of $135 million led by Reverence Capital Partners. Holland’s ING, Spain’s Santander (via InnoVentures, Santander's venture capital arm); and Canada’s Scotiabank also participated in the round. Kabbage also announced a strategic partnership with ING to deliver instant capital to small businesses throughout Spain.

In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row

In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transaction’s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbage’s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015.

In 2017, the company raised $250 million from Softbank Group Corp., raising its total equity funding to $500 million, making Kabbage one of the most well-funded companies with a female co-founder at the helm. It also secured the largest asset-backed securitizations of small business loans in the online lending industry of $525 million. In November, it diversified its debt-funding sources further with a $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse, earning investment-grade ratings of ‘A’ and ‘BBB’ by DBRS. It ranked on the Inc. 500 list as one of the country’s fasting-growing private companies for a third consecutive year, on Deloitte’s Fast 500 list, among CB Insights Fintech 250, in the top 10 of KPMG’s Fiintech 100, and its co-founder, Kathryn Petralia, was named one of Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World.

China Telecom has subsidiary companies in 31 provinces (municipal and autonomous regions) and branches in the Americas, Europe, Hong Kong and Marco, and its communications network covering the whole country of China and reaching every corner of the world. China Telecom built the world biggest CDMA 3G network, with its earliest commercial services in China, having many branded products such as “Tianyi”, “My e Home”, “BizNavigator”, “Best Tone”, being capable of providing all telecom services and multiple convergent services and sales channels. China Telecom has two holding companies, “China Telecom Corporation Limited” and “China Communications Services Corporation Limited”. Both of them were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, New York Stock Exchanges in 2002 and in Hong Kong Stock Exchanges in 2006 respectively. Therefore, the operation structure of main business and sideline business came into being with both companies listed on the public stock market.
Since the year of 2004 when China Telecom made the strategic decision for transformation from the traditional basic telecom operator to an integrated information services provider, China Telecom is developing in a steady and healthy manner by promoting the integrated information services and other non-voice service, and by intensifying the precise management and optimal resource allocations. Especially after the telecom system restructure in 2008, and obtaining the mobile business license and 3G service license in 2009, China Telecom realized the good beginning of development.

While exploring the value increase of the enterprise, China Telecom conscientiously implement its responsibility as an enterprise by upholding the concept of co-existence and harmonious unity between the corporate development and social development, between the environment protection and the relevant parties who have interests with us. China Telecom is implementing its social responsibilities in providing working opportunities for the public and making contributions to the public welfare and undertaking the tasks of assisting the poor in the Tibet Region. China Telecom also takes action to reduce the energy and the consumptions, to implement the sharing policy to avoid wastes and duplication investment for the protection of the “ecology environment of the Industry”. China Telecom successfully completed the guaranteed telecommunications services for the earthquake rescue and relief operations and the Beijing Olympic Games. As the main force of the informatization construction in the country, China Telecom focuses on the R&D and promotes the informatization applications to provide the brand new multiple services, multiple network and multiple terminals and the extension of the value chain in order to bring the benefits of the informatization to all the cycles of the industry and the public as well. China Telecom provided specific informatization solutions to more than 20 industries and a large number of the enterprises.

China Telecom established the application & promotion centre and the key laboratory for the Internet of Things in Wuxi, Jiangsu province. China Telecom conscientiously fulfilled its obligation for the universal service in serving the “New Three Fs Policy” (meaning concerns for the village, peasants, agriculture), continuing the projects of the “telephone installation in every village” and the model projects of the informatization in all villages and townships. China Telecom has provided the public with the integrated information services related with food, clothing, housing, transport, and daily necessities, etc., and made proper contributions in providing the information life to the public by driving up the convergence of the informatization and industrialization, and the rural informatization construction.

Then, beginning in 2005, management focused on RCNâ€:tm:s strategic Northeast Corridor and Chicago markets, selling non-core assets including its 49% stake in Megacable, the largest cable company in Mexico, as well as its West Coast assets.

With close to a decade of experience providing cable TV, Internet and phone service using fiber optics already under its belt, RCN again grew significantly in 2006. First, the company acquired Con Edison Communications (CEC), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., with its own fiber-optic network in New York City. The combination of CEC with RCNâ€:tm:s existing business services capability created the subsidiary RCN Business Solutions. Second, RCN completed a substantial network upgrade, including conversion to a 100% digital network.

In 2007, RCN Business Solutions acquired NEON Communications gaining an advanced fiber-optic network stretching across twelve northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. NEON was a wholesale service provider of high-bandwidth transport services to service providers and Fortune 100 companies. With this acquisition, RCN Business Solutions became RCN Metro Optical Networks, a leading facilities-based provider to medium and large carriers and enterprises in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Chicago metro area. 

RCN entered a new phase in 2008. Now equipped with two business units, Residential and Small Business and RCN Metro Optical Networks, serving three customer segments, the company continues to win customers in its markets. RCN is accelerating its movement to an all-digital video platform, enabling an increase in high-definition availability and improving picture quality to cable TV customers, and is continuing to offer the fastest high-speed Internet available with cable modem speeds that challenge industry standards.

Instead of stocking every item in every available brand, Sam’s Club merchants do the homework for our members, stocking the right products and purchasing them in large quantities, passing on the savings to our members. Sam’s Club also reduces costs by maintaining a simple shopping environment, often displaying their merchandise on shipping pallets so they can move new items in just as quickly as they move out. 

Sam’s Club also provides a variety of member services to extend the value of membership, such as Instant Savings, Cash Rewards, 5-3-1 cashback MasterCard, free monthly health screenings, daily “Tastes & Tips” sampling demonstrations, and members-only savings on travel, prescriptions, and fuel. Sam’s Club offers several convenience services tailored to the needs of small business owners, too, including small business loans and online solutions for critical business operations like payroll and HR, legal, accounting, digital marketing, and health care needs. 

Sam’s Club's founder Sam Walton was the most notable business leader of his time—but no matter how much success he achieved, he never forgot where it all started. Once a humble entrepreneur with a successful five-and-dime, Mr. Sam knew firsthand the challenges of running a small business. 

Passionate for leadership through service, Mr. Sam wanted to leverage his resources to help other entrepreneurs like himself access the products and services they needed to make their small businesses succeed. That’s why in 1983, he opened the first Sam’s Club in Midwest City, Okla. 

Today, Sam’s Club wants to be the most valuable membership club in the world for its members.

We provide solutions for clients with complex and novel language resource requirements by understanding the issues that lie at the intersection of language and technology.

Many children are spending time in hospitals and institutional care unnecessarily while home care is 10 times less expensive, more effective, and convenient. The pediatric home care market has not kept pace with this growing demand and is in need of thousands more nurses. 

To address the growing demand for pediatric home care, Swift Shift is reimagining pediatric home care delivery by creating the first nurse-managed pediatric home care service. Our long term mission is to increase the number of pediatric nurses who choose to work in this field so that every child can access reliable home care. 

Our unique offering creates more meaningful relationships between patients, families, and nurses. We’ve replaced office-based case managers with nurse care teams and empower them to manage the safe transition from the hospital to long-term home-based care. These self-managed teams choose their patients and control their schedules, creating a greater sense of ownership over their care management. 

We use an AI-based home care management platform to help our care teams focus on delivering care. No more manuals, no more paper! By providing all the relevant data in an easy-to-access interface, nurses can make better decisions for the well-being of their patients.

Most importantly, at Swift Shift we know the best patient outcomes start and end with the best nursing experience.

We offer value-driven products and tools that solve a broad range of IT management challenges—whether those challenges are related to networks, servers, applications, storage, virtualization, cloud, or development operations.

If there is a piece of IT infrastructure anywhere in the world where performance matters, SolarWinds provides the technology to manage it.

Whether you’re an army of one managing a small environment, an MSP responsible for multiple customers, part of an IT team managing an enterprise, or you’ve migrated to the cloud—if you care about IT performance—SolarWinds has powerful, easy-to-use, and affordable products to help you manage it.

We distinguish ourselves by refusing to accept the status quo established by most technology vendors. Face it: The vast majority of IT management tools today are difficult to use, expensive, and really don’t address the realities of today’s real-world IT challenges. Too many IT pros have resigned themselves to accept the frustration.

But we don’t think enterprise-grade software or services have to be so complex. We think that great technology not only makes it much easier to manage infrastructure, but empowers IT to actually delight end users.

At SolarWinds, we’re fanatical about putting users first in everything we do. We strive every day to deliver powerful functionality that’s easy to use with one of the fastest and longest-lasting ROIs in the market. As a result, SolarWinds is one of the world’s most award-winning, peer-recommended and continuously-licensed product families year after year.

Our approach is to deliver unexpected simplicity and redefine the management and monitoring expectations for all aspects of IT, MSPs, and DevOps pros.

Simply put, we work to:

Eliminate the complexity found in traditional enterprise software and services—we make it easy to find, buy, deploy and maintain solutions, regardless of an organization’s size.

Connect with our community—we interact daily with our large, global user community to guide our product development and strategy, and foster an environment where users with even the most complex IT challenges quickly connect with experts who love to help.

Constantly evolve our products—we ensure our software is on point to meet the most important problems that IT pros, MSPs, and DevOps engineers have today, and continues to deliver increasing value over the lifetime of ownership.
Our company was built by IT administrators and senior systems engineers who know what it takes to manage today’s dynamic IT environments. They combine this expertise with a deep connection to the IT community to create IT management products that are effective, accessible and easy to use.

The result?

IT management software that works for you—and that delivers on our promise of unexpected simplicity.",NULL,"2020-08-01 00:33:00","2021-01-20 05:21:16","SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC",solarwinds,http://www.facebook.com/SolarWinds,http://www.linkedin.com/company/solarwinds,http://twitter.com/solarwinds,SWI,http://www.solarwinds.com,"["Hardware", "Information Technology", "Internet Services", "Privacy and Security", "Software"]",Austin,Texas,"United States",USA,Crunchbase,"["Cloud Management", "Enterprise Software", "Information Technology", "IT Infrastructure", "IT Management", "Management Information Systems", "Network Security", "Software", "Virtualization"]",5401,1

Neat’s unique combination of cloud, mobile, desktop software, and hardware scanning solutions  create a comprehensive Digital Filing System that helps simplify everyday tasks so their customers have more time to do what matters.

Founded in 2002, Neat is an innovative and fast-growing technology company headquartered in the heart of Philadelphia. They manufacture and market a unique combination of software and hardware scanning solutions that use optical character recognition (OCR) and patented parsing technology to read and convert information on receipts, business cards, and documents and then store the information in a Digital Filing System.

Their best-selling NeatDesk® product is a high-speed desktop scanner and Digital Filing System that quickly transforms all the paper on a person’s desk into organized digital files.

Neat’s proprietary software features an intuitive design that makes it easy for users to identify, extract, organize, and store key information from their paper files.

In 2012, Neat launched NeatCloud®, their subscription-based cloud service with a robust mobile app. Now their customers can add to – or access – their Neat accounts from anywhere, even using the cameras on their mobile devices to “scan” items on the go.

Neat’s products, which are available for both PC and Mac users, are available directly from the Neat online store, at select retail stores, and through authorized resellers. 

Neat has been named to the Inc. 500 list three consecutive years, is a past winner of the Philly 100 and the Deloitte Fast 50, and has been recognized for product innovation by the Consumer Electronics Association, iF Design Awards, Red Dot Design Awards, and Spark!

The newly merged company turned its focus to creating a software that would help life sciences companies find external innovations.

Since then, we’ve worked exclusively in the life sciences, learning the pains and challenges of this industry inside and out. We’re constantly developing new partnerships and new features to help biopharma companies work together better.

For example, we have a strategic partnership with the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, organizer of the largest biopharma partnering event of the year. Thanks to this partnership, our CRM is prepopulated with company and contact information from BIO partnering meetings.

The core value proposition is helping consumers save time and money simplifying the everyday process of information access.  
People rely on electronic alerts and reminders for many of their daily tasks. The plethora of sources for such content necessitates going to many different sites to sign up for or to manage multiple reminders and notifications â€” an aggravating and time-consuming dilemma.Â Intelligent agents perform searches on behalf of users and deliver alerts reminder and notification messages via email, voice, text, and more.  

Alerts.com is offering its technology assets (single click multi-mode delivery of content) as a free emergency and notification platform made available to all schools in north America.  Schools invite parents to opt-in to the platform who in turn also sign up to receive pertinent alerts and reminders.

Alerts.com licenses a private label version of the platform to local TV and Radio stations nationally, helping them drive users to their web properties, create susbscriptions, user profiles and monetize the user base via targeted ads in the messages sent. 

For advertisers, Alerts.com offers a unique 100% opt-in highly profiled audience reach platform: what you alert yourself about is who you are.

We’d experienced first-hand how Salesforce allowed anyone to become a Trailblazer and build amazing apps, but then left you stranded, with only Change Sets or complex command lines to get your work to users. Gearset makes DevOps on Salesforce as simple as everything else on Salesforce.

Starting with release management, we’ve developed Gearset into the comprehensive DevOps tool it is today by focusing relentlessly on two things: simplicity and deployment success. Gearset’s core deployment engine makes sure more of your deployments work, first time. We’ve built the exceptional team you see below to ensure the deployment engine gets smarter and smarter, the more people use the app.

Over the past four years, our team has obsessively used customer feedback to drive Gearset’s daily releases, building a platform that can handle even the most complex ALM workflows. Gearset’s integrations with leading providers such as GitHub, Azure DevOps and Atlassian mean you’re getting the best of breed in all aspects of your pipeline.

Gearset is now the leading DevOps tool for Salesforce. It scales from teams first dipping their toes into DevOps right through to teams of hundreds of people making the most of parallel development and continuous delivery.",NULL,"2020-09-17 06:51:38","2021-01-20 03:49:35",NULL,gearset,https://www.facebook.com/pg/gearsethq,https://www.linkedin.com/company/gearset,https://twitter.com/GearsetHQ,NULL,https://gearset.com,"["Information Technology", "Internet Services", "Sales and Marketing", "Software"]",Cambridge,Cambridgeshire,"United Kingdom",GBR,Crunchbase,"["Developer Platform", "Developer Tools", "Internet", "SaaS", "Sales Automation", "Software"]",7073,1

6081,552,"Galvanize, Inc.",FRISS,"Friss is the provider of analytics software for fraud, risk, and compliance for P&C insurers. Friss has 100% dedication to fraud, risk, and compliance for non-life insurance companies worldwide. FRISS helps insurers to achieve profitable portfolio growth and improve their perception in the market as trustworthy insurer. FRISS is a ready-to-use business solution and improves the insurers' loss ratios by identifying high risks and fraud at quotation, underwriting, and claim handling across all private and commercial lines.

The FRISS® Score enables better decisions since it indicates the risk for each quotation, policy or claim. FRISS is global market leader with 150+ implementations in over 30 countries.

FRISS (www.friss.com) offers a complete solution for fraud, risk and compliance. 

☆ Risk assessment at underwriting ☆
Generate profitable growth for your portfolio by real-time automated detection and assessment of risks during the underwriting process. It is important to prevent fraud and assess risks by having a holistic view of prospects before they enter your portfolio. The FRISS underwriting solution provides an intelligent and uniform risk estimation, which is proven to improve the combined ratio significantly.

☆ Prevent and detect fraud at claims ☆
The general assumption is that, at average, around 10% of all Insurance Claims are tied to some sort of fraud. In order to finance these malicious claims, we all pay additional for our Insurance Policies. Three things are important:
- How to detect fraud correctly and efficiently?
- How to detect malicious customers in time?
- How do you handle this in your daily operational business?
Reduce your loss ratio by increasing the chances of detecting fraud and limit false positives to a minimum. Use automated fraud detection during the claims process to make an accurate and objective estimation of the risks related to a claim. It improves straight through processing (STP), and claims that need further attention will be recognized directly.

☆ Become and stay compliant ☆
Compliance concerns all insurance processes. Become and stay compliant with the latest legislation and regulations. Knowing and screening your customers will prevent reputational damage and avoids high penalties. Gain insight into Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs). This will enhance the quality of your underwriting process. Furthermore, administrative burdens will be reduced to a minimum.
