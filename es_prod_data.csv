PS-8\nTable of Contents\nU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the notes will be treated as debt instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar and should be treated as ""variable rate debt instruments"" providing for a single fixed rate followed by a single qualified floating rate (""QFR""), as described in the sections of the accompanying Prospectus called ""U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations-Taxation of Debt Securities-Consequences to U.S. Holders-Variable Rate Debt Securities"" and ""-Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities."" Some of the selling agents and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial\ndealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Typically, such selling agents and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. Our notes are unsecured and are not savings accounts, deposits, or other obligations of a bank. You should read each of these documents before investing in the notes. If there are any differences between the information contained in the applicable pricing supplement or any document dated after the date of this prospectus supplement and incorporated by reference into the accompanying prospectus, the information contained in such later pricing supplement or document will supersede the information in this prospectus supplement. The distribution of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the offering of the notes in some jurisdictions may be restricted by law. If you have received this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should find out about and observe these restrictions. IMPORTANT - EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. A supplement also may include a discussion of any risk factors or other special additional considerations that apply to a particular type of note. Unless we indicate otherwise or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this prospectus supplement to ""Bank of America,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" or similar references are to Bank of America Corporation excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. Any term that is used, but not defined, in this prospectus supplement has the meaning set forth in the accompanying prospectus. For information regarding risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business and results, please refer to the information under the captions ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed in our subsequent filings that are incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus. These risks include fluctuation of the interest rates and the possibility that you will receive an amount of interest that is lower than expected. In recent years, interest rates have been volatile, and that volatility may be expected in the future. In addition, we or our affiliates may acquire a long or short position in the notes from time to time. However, we cannot assure you that our activities or affiliates\' activities will not affect these values. We or our affiliates also may enter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments that we issue, some of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that of a particular series of notes. Any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on the value of, return on and trading market for the notes. This section supplements, and should be read together with, the general description of our debt securities included in ""Description of Debt Securities"" in the accompanying prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should rely on the information in this prospectus supplement. We will describe the particular terms of the notes we sell in a separate supplement. The terms and conditions stated in this section will apply to each note unless the note or the applicable supplement indicates otherwise. General\nIn addition to the following summary of the general terms of the notes and the indentures, you should review the actual notes and the specific provisions of the 2018 Senior Indenture and the 2018 Subordinated Indenture, as applicable, which we have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement forms a part. The Indentures are subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The notes are our direct unsecured obligations and are not obligations of our subsidiaries. We may issue other debt securities under the Indentures from time to time in one or more series up to the aggregate principal amount of the then-existing grant of authority by our board of directors. For more information on fixed-rate notes and amortizing notes, see ""Description of Debt Securities - Fixed-Rate Notes"" in the accompanying prospectus. For example, a debt security may bear interest at a fixed rate for some periods and at a floating rate in others. We will describe the determination of interest for any of these debt securities in the applicable supplement. Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\nPaying Agents. That office is currently located at 10161 Centurion Parkway N., 2nd Floor, Jacksonville, Florida 32256. However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, holders of beneficial interests in notes through a participant in The Depository Trust Company, or ""DTC,"" will receive payments in U.S. dollars, unless they elect to receive payments on those notes in the applicable foreign currency. The above provisions do not apply if a specified currency is unavailable because it has been replaced by the euro. If we so specify in the applicable supplement, and subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the accompanying prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities - Payment of Additional Amounts,"" we will pay to the beneficial holder of notes that is a ""United States Alien"" additional amounts to ensure that every net payment on such notes will not be less, due to the payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then otherwise due and payable. These additional amounts will constitute additional interest on the note. For this purpose, U.S. withholding tax means a withholding tax of the United States, other than a territory or possession. S-13\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of determining whether the payment of additional amounts is required, the term ""United States Alien"" means any person who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership to the extent that one or more of its members is, for United States federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust. In addition, the senior notes and the subordinated notes will be unsecured and therefore in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding will effectively rank junior to our secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. See also ""Description of Debt\nSecurities - Redemption"" in the accompanying prospectus. The redemption of any note that is our eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board if after such redemption we would fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total loss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules. If the notes may be repaid prior to their stated maturity, the applicable supplement will indicate the amount at which we will repay the notes and the procedure for repayment. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, to the extent then required by applicable laws or regulations, the subordinated notes may not be repaid prior to their stated maturity without the requisite prior approvals, if any, from applicable regulators. However, any new notes of this kind may have a different offering price and may begin to bear interest at a different date. This kind of global note represents multiple notes that have different terms and are issued at different times. This means that we will not issue certificated notes in definitive form to each beneficial owner. For notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the notes may be issued in the form of two global notes, each in fully registered form, one of which will be deposited with DTC, or its custodian, and one of which will be deposited with a common depository for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") and/or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, Luxembourg (""Clearstream""). If we ever issue notes in definitive form, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, those notes will be in registered form, and the exchange, registration, or transfer of those notes will be governed by the applicable Indenture and the procedures described under ""Description of Debt Securities - Exchange, Registration, and Transfer"" in the accompanying prospectus. You should consult with your own tax advisor before investing in the notes. The selling agents may act either on a principal basis or on an agency basis. The commission will be determined at the time of sale and will be specified in the applicable supplement. After the initial public offering of notes, the selling agent may change the public offering price or the discount allowed to dealers. However, no selling agent is obligated to do so, and any selling agent may discontinue making a market in the notes at any time without notice. There is no assurance that there will be a secondary market for any of the notes. A selling agent may place a stabilizing bid to purchase a note for the purpose of pegging, fixing, or maintaining the price of that note. The selling agents are not required to engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities at any time. Resales of this kind may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. Notes may be sold in connection with a remarketing\nS-19\nTable of Contents\nafter their purchase by one or more firms. Any of our affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions. Notes sold in market-making transactions include notes issued after the date of this prospectus supplement as well as previously-issued securities. Information about the trade and settlement dates, as well as the purchase price, for a market-making transaction will be provided to the purchaser in a separate confirmation of sale. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to a trade expressly agree otherwise. The notes may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 of Bermuda which regulates the sale of securities in Bermuda.

The notes may not be offered to the public in the Cayman Islands. Due to the complexity of the notes offered, the notes may not be suitable for certain investors. Investors who intend to buy the notes should consult with their financial advisors, brokers or other financial experts before making any decision to buy the notes. This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are intended solely for investors listed in the First Supplement of the Israeli Securities Law of 1968, as amended. A prospectus has not been prepared or filed, and will not be prepared or filed, in Israel relating to the notes offered hereunder. In particular, no offering document or other material has been reviewed or approved by the Israel Securities Authority. Furthermore, Article 100-bis of the Financial Services Act affects the transferability of the notes in the Republic of Italy to the extent that any placing of the notes is made solely with qualified investors and the notes are then systematically resold to non-qualified investors on the secondary market at any time in the 12 months following such placing. As the offering of the notes satisfies the requirements provided in Article 2, Paragraph 3, Item 2(i) or Article 2, Paragraph 4, Item 2(i) of the FIEL, no securities registration statement has been or will be filed under Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the FIEL. Bank of America Corporation is an entity incorporated pursuant to the laws of the United States of America and holds no authorization permit or license issued by any Mexican governmental agency, regulator or authority in order to operate as a financial entity in Mexico and is not subject to the supervision of Mexican financial authorities. Each selling agent has represented and agreed, and each further selling agent appointed in connection with the notes will be required to represent and agree, that it has not made and will not make an offer of the notes to the public in the Netherlands other than to qualified investors (\ngekwalificeerde beleggers\n), provided that no such offer of the notes will require us or any selling agent to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive. No action has been taken to permit the notes to be offered or sold to any retail investor, or otherwise under any regulated offer in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (""FMCA""). ANY FUTURE OFFER OR SALE THEREOF IS SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES REGULATION CODE UNLESS SUCH OFFER OR SALE QUALIFIES AS AN EXEMPT TRANSACTION.

Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, New York, New York or such other counsel as may be indicated in the applicable supplement will pass upon certain legal matters relating to the notes for the selling agents. This prospectus provides a general description of material terms of these securities that are known as of the date of this prospectus and the general manner in which we will offer the securities. When we sell a particular issue of securities, we will provide one or more supplements to this prospectus describing the offering and the specific terms of those securities. In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, or any of our other broker- dealer affiliates, may use this prospectus in a market-making transaction in any of these securities after their initial sale. Potential purchasers of our securities should consider the information set forth in the ""\nRisk Factors\n"" section beginning on page 9. These documents also may add, update, or change information contained in this prospectus. The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. You should rely only on the information provided in or incorporated by\nreference in this prospectus, the applicable supplement, or documents to which we otherwise refer you. We are not making an offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may have changed since that date. Bank of America Corporation\nBank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company, and a financial holding company. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the United States and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products. Our principal executive offices are located in the Bank of America Corporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255 and our telephone number is (704) 386-5681. This prospectus, including this summary, describes the general terms of the securities we may offer. 4\nTable of Contents\nDebt Securities\nOur debt securities may be either senior or subordinated obligations in right of payment. Our senior and subordinated debt securities will be issued under separate indentures, or contracts, that we have with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The particular terms of each series of debt securities that we offer under this prospectus will be described in the applicable supplement. We will issue units under unit agreements that we will enter into with one or more unit agents. Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares\nWe may offer our preferred stock in one or more series. Listing\nWe will state in the applicable supplement whether the particular securities that we are offering will be listed or quoted on a securities exchange or quotation system. Prospective investors should consult their own financial, legal, tax, and other professional advisors as to the risks associated with an investment in our securities and the suitability of the investment for the investor. In our current plan, our preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry (""SPOE"") strategy. Certain of our remaining assets secure our ongoing obligations under these intercompany arrangements. In addition, our preferred resolution strategy could result in holders of our securities being in a worse position and suffering greater losses than would have been the case under bankruptcy or other resolution scenarios or plans. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its preferred ""single point of entry"" strategy for resolving a G-SIB. The FDIC\'s single point of entry strategy may result in holders of our securities suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy. Under the rules of the Federal Reserve relating to total loss-absorbing capacity (the ""TLAC Rules""), we are required to maintain minimum amounts of unsecured external long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria (""eligible LTD"") and other loss-absorbing capacity for the purpose of absorbing our losses in a resolution proceeding under either the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Title II of the Financial Reform Act. Either of these resolution strategies could result in holders of our debt securities being in a worse position and suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a different resolution strategy. See ""Description of Debt Securities-Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets"" below for more information. Often, the only way to liquidate your investment in the debt securities prior to maturity will be to sell the debt securities. If you sell your debt securities prior to maturity, you may receive less than the principal amount of such debt securities. Acceleration rights for our subordinated debt securities are available only in limited circumstances. For additional information regarding the subordination provisions applicable to the subordinated debt securities, see ""Description of Debt Securities-Subordination"" below. Redemption of our debt securities prior to maturity may result in a reduced return on your investment. The terms of our debt securities may permit or require redemption of the debt securities prior to maturity. We are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends. Adverse business and economic conditions may reduce our capital ratios below requirements. 13\nTable of Contents\nOur common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock. Shares of our common stock are equity interests in us and do not constitute indebtedness. Our preferred stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payment of dividends on our preferred stock. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of our preferred stock (1) dividends are payable only when, as and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors and (2) as a corporation, we are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments on our preferred stock out of legally available funds. 14\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Certain Floating Rate Securities\nRegulation, reform, and the potential or actual discontinuation of ""benchmarks,"" including LIBOR and EURIBOR, may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our floating rate securities that are based on a ""benchmark."" We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that a secondary market for any of our securities will develop, or that if one develops, it will be maintained. Payments on the securities are subject to our credit risk, and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness may affect the value of our securities. The Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about the significant terms and conditions of the Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities, non-U.S. dollar currency transactions, or financial matters in general. These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies in the global markets. Consequently, you will bear the risk that your investment may be affected adversely by these types of events. Foreign currency exchange rates either can float or be fixed by sovereign governments. Governments or governmental bodies, including the European Central Bank, may intervene from time to time in their economies to alter the exchange rate or exchange characteristics of their currencies. For example, a central bank may intervene to devalue or revalue a currency or to replace an existing currency. 19\nTable of Contents\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION\nBank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company, and a financial holding company. Until we designate the use of these net proceeds, we will invest them temporarily. From time to time, we may engage in additional financings as we determine appropriate based on our needs and prevailing market conditions. These additional financings may include the sale of other securities. Neither the senior debt securities nor the subordinated debt securities will be secured by any of our property or assets. The senior debt securities will constitute part of our senior debt, will be issued under our senior debt indentures described below, and will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding, except obligations, including deposit liabilities, that are subject to any priorities or preferences by law. This means that we may issue additional debt securities and other securities at any time without your consent and without notifying you. This section is a summary of the general terms and provisions of the indentures. See ""Where You Can Find More Information"" below for information on how to obtain copies of the indentures. You must look to the indentures for the most complete description of the information summarized in this prospectus. Accordingly, the depository will be the registered holder of all the debt securities represented by the global security. Generally, all debt securities represented by the same global security will have the same terms. We may, however, issue a global security that represents multiple debt securities that have different terms and are issued at different times. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue our debt securities in fully registered form, without coupons. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we will describe the special considerations applicable to bearer securities in the applicable supplement. We may do so without notice to the existing holders of debt securities of that series. We will describe the financial and other specific terms of the series of debt securities being offered in the applicable supplement. If there are any differences between the applicable supplement and this prospectus, the applicable supplement will control. We may issue debt securities that bear interest at one or more fixed rates of interest, as specified in the applicable supplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each fixed-rate note will bear interest from its original issue date or from the most recent date to which interest on the fixed-rate note has been paid or made available for payment. Payments on amortizing notes are applied first to interest due and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount. The supplement for an amortizing note will include a table setting forth repayment information. For any floating-rate note, the ""index maturity"" is the period to maturity of the instrument for which the base rate is calculated and will be specified in the applicable supplement. These limits do not apply to loans of $2,500,000 or more to any one borrower. We will make payments on floating-rate notes as described below under the heading ""-Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable."" We refer to each date on which the interest rate for a floating-rate note will reset as an ""interest reset date."" The ""interest determination date"" for any interest reset date is the day the calculation agent will refer to when determining the new interest rate at which a floating rate will reset. If, as a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the preceding Friday, that preceding Friday will be the interest determination date pertaining to the interest reset date occurring in the next succeeding week. If Treasury bills are sold at an auction that falls on a day that is an interest reset date, that interest reset date will be the next following business day unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement. We will specify the interest reset dates in the applicable supplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the calculation date for any interest determination date will be the date by which the calculation agent computes the amount of interest owed on a floating-rate note for the related interest period. Accrued interest on a floating-rate note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by an accrued interest factor. If three quotations are provided, the calculation agent will determine LIBOR as the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If such investment bank of national standing determines that there is such a substitute or successor base rate, the calculation agent shall use such substitute or successor base rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR will be the average of those quotations. Each CDOR note will bear interest at the Canadian dollar Bankers\' Acceptance Rate (""CDOR""), adjusted by any spread or spread multiplier, as specified in the applicable supplement. Each treasury rate note will bear interest at the treasury rate, adjusted by any spread or spread multiplier, as specified in the applicable supplement. If fewer than three brokers selected by us are quoting as described above, the federal funds rate will be the federal funds rate in effect on that interest determination date. The following procedures will be followed if the prime rate cannot be determined as described above:\nIf the rate is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related calculation date, then the prime rate will be the rate as published in any other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption ""Bank prime loan"" (or in another recognized electronic source determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion). Original Issue Discount Notes\nA fixed-rate note or a floating-rate note may be an original issue discount note. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the trustee will act as our sole paying agent, security registrar, and transfer agent with respect to the debt securities through the trustee\'s office. In addition, we may decide to act as our own paying agent with respect to some or all of the debt securities, and the paying agent may resign. We refer to each date on which interest is payable on a debt security as an ""interest payment date."" Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the record date for any interest payment for a debt security in book-entry only form generally will be the date that is two business days (in the case of debt securities denominated in Canadian dollars) or one business day (for all other debt securities, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement) prior to the payment date. ""Modified following business day convention (adjusted)"" means, if an interest payment date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a business day, then such interest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, except that, if the next succeeding business day falls in the next calendar month, then such interest payment date will be advanced to the immediately preceding day that is a business day. Interest reset dates and interest periods also are not adjusted for\nnon-business days under the following unadjusted business day convention. We also may specify and describe a different business day convention from those described above in the applicable supplement. Book-entry and other indirect owners should contact their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. We will make payments on non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities in book-entry only form in the applicable specified currency in accordance with arrangements then in place between the paying agent and the depository or its nominee, as holder. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, holders of beneficial interests in non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities through a participant in The Depository Trust Company, or ""DTC,"" will receive payments in U.S. dollars, unless they elect to receive payments on those debt securities in the applicable foreign currency. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, if the specified currency is unavailable and has been replaced by another currency that has become legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing the specified currency as of the original issue date (a ""replacement currency""), we may satisfy our obligations to holders of the non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security by making those payments on the date of payment in the replacement currency or in U.S. dollars, at our option. In any such case, the exchange rate agent to be appointed by us may be one of our affiliates, and, from time to time after the initial appointment of an exchange rate agent, we may appoint one or more different exchange rate agents for the relevant non-U.S. dollar denominated debt security without your consent and without notifying you of the change. Absent manifest error, those determinations will be final and binding on you and us. Redemption\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether we may redeem the debt securities prior to their stated maturity. If specified in the applicable supplement, we may redeem the debt securities of any series, at our option, in whole, but not in part, on the interest payment dates or other dates specified in the applicable supplement upon at least 10 business days\' but not more than 60 calendar days\' prior written notice to holders of the applicable series of debt securities being redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of debt securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. So long as a depository is the record holder of the applicable debt securities to be redeemed, we, or the trustee on our behalf if we so request, will deliver any notice of our election to exercise our redemption right only to that depository. Conversion\nWe may issue debt securities that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, at either our option or the holder\'s option or otherwise as provided in the applicable supplement, our preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, or other debt securities. There will not be a service charge for any exchange or registration of transfer of debt securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with the exchange or transfer. At any time, we may designate additional transfer agents for any series of debt securities. For a discussion of restrictions on the exchange, registration, and transfer of book-entry only securities, see ""Registration and Settlement"" below. In addition, holders of subordinated debt securities may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. If a meeting of holders is duly held, any resolution raised or decision taken in accordance with the indenture will be binding on all holders of debt securities of that series. Any additional or different events of default for a series of senior debt securities will be specified in the applicable supplement. The 2018 Subordinated Indenture and 1995 Subordinated Indenture define an event of default for subordinated debt securities only as our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws (and, in the case of our involuntary bankruptcy, continuing for a period of 60 days) and any other events of default specified for a series of subordinated debt securities pursuant to the applicable Subordinated Indenture. Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on a debt security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner of the debt security being a bank extending credit under a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business. Except as specifically provided in this section, we will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge imposed by any government, political subdivision, or taxing authority of that government. If we ever fully defeased your debt security, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for payments on your debt security. We may issue warrants, including securities warrants, index warrants and currency warrants. We will describe the specific terms of a series of warrants and the applicable warrant agreement in the applicable supplement. Modification\nWe and the warrant agent may amend the terms of any warrant agreement and the warrants without the consent of the holders of the warrants to cure any ambiguity, to correct any inconsistent provision, or in any other manner we deem necessary or desirable and which will not affect adversely the interests of the holders. Any record holder or beneficial owner of a warrant, without anyone else\'s consent, may enforce by appropriate legal action, on his or her own behalf, his or her right to exercise the warrant in accordance with its terms. Therefore, holders of warrants issued under a warrant agreement will not have the protection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to their warrants. We may offer purchase contracts separately or as part of a unit, as described below under the heading ""Description of Units."" When we refer to a series of purchase contracts, we mean all purchase contracts issued as part of the same series under the applicable purchase contract. This section describes some of the general terms and provisions applicable to all purchase contracts. See ""Where You Can Find More Information"" below for information on how to obtain copies of any purchase contracts. We refer to each type of property described above as a ""purchase contract property."" Non-prepaid purchase contracts will be issued under a unit agreement, if they are issued in units, or under some other document, if they are not. We describe unit agreements generally under the heading ""Description of Units"" below. We refer to this as the ""pledge"" and all the items described below as the ""pledged items."" The unit agent will not so apply the principal payments if the holder has delivered cash to meet its obligations under the purchase contract. If the holder is permitted to settle its obligations by cash payment, the holder may be permitted to do so by delivering the debt securities\n63\nTable of Contents\nin the unit to the unit agent as provided in the governing document. 64\nTable of Contents\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS\nGeneral\nWe may issue units from time to time in such amounts and in as many distinct series as we determine. We will issue each series of units under a unit agreement to be entered into between us and a unit agent to be designated in the applicable supplement. This section describes some of the general terms and provisions applicable to all the units. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. We may also issue units under other kinds of unit agreements, which will be described in the applicable supplement, if applicable. These are described above under the heading ""Description of Purchase Contracts."" We describe these terms in other sections of this prospectus relating to debt securities, warrants, and purchase contracts. 66\nTable of Contents\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK\nGeneral\nWe may issue preferred stock in one or more series, each with the preferences, designations, limitations, conversion rights, and other rights as we may determine. Any preferred stock sold under this prospectus will have the general dividend, voting, and liquidation preference rights stated below unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement. Shares represented by an existing certificate will remain certificated until such certificate is surrendered to us. All dividends will be paid out of funds that are legally available for this purpose. Voting\nThe holders of our preferred stock will have no voting rights except:\nas required by applicable law; or\nas specifically approved by us for that particular series.

In addition, holders of our preferred stock, or depositary shares representing interests in our preferred stock, may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 3.87 million issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock and the aggregate liquidation preference of all of our outstanding preferred stock was approximately $23.5 billion.

If any quarterly dividend payable on the Series L Preferred Stock is in arrears for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote as a class, together with the holders of all series of our preferred stock ranking equally with the Series L Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted to the holders of Series L Preferred Stock have been conferred and are exercisable, for the election of two Preferred Stock Directors.

We may redeem the Series 5 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at our option, at the redemption price equal to $30,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Withdrawal of Preferred Stock\nUnless the depositary shares have been called for redemption, a holder of depositary shares may surrender his or her depositary receipts at the principal office of the depository, pay any charges, and comply with any other terms as provided in the deposit agreement for the number of shares of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares. If the depositary shares surrendered by the holder in connection with the withdrawal exceed the number of depositary shares that represent the number of whole shares of preferred stock to be withdrawn, the depository will deliver to the holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Any balance that is not distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum received by the depository for distribution to record holders. However, if the depository determines that it is not feasible to make this distribution of property, the depository, with our approval, may sell that property and distribute the net proceeds to the holders of the depositary shares. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable on that series of the preferred stock. We will agree to take all action which may be deemed necessary by the depository to enable the depository to do so. Resignation and Removal of Depository\nThe depository may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so, and we may remove the depository at any time. Any successor depository must be a U.S. bank or trust company. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""BAC."" Voting and Other Rights\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. We refer to those who, indirectly through others, own beneficial interests in securities that are not registered in their own names as indirect owners or beneficial owners of those securities. Book-Entry Only Issuance\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each security in global, or book-entry, form. This means that we will make all payments on the securities, including deliveries of any property other than cash, to the depository. Instead, they do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers. As long as the securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect owners, and not holders, of the securities. These institutions pass along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be indirect owners, not holders, of those securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, who hold the securities in street name, or who hold the securities by any other indirect means. For example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for that payment or notice even if that holder is required, under agreements with depository participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect owners, but does not do so. Whether and how the holders contact the indirect owners is up to the holders. A security usually will have only one depository, but it may have more. The depositories named above also may be participants in one another\'s clearing systems. We will name the depository or depositories for your securities in the applicable supplement. We may also issue one or more global securities that represent multiple series of debt securities. Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly (""indirect participants""). The DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with the SEC. Information on that website is not included or incorporated by reference herein. DTC\'s practice is to credit direct participants\' accounts upon DTC\'s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us, on the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC\'s records. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository for the securities at any time by giving us reasonable notice. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide various services including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg also deal with domestic securities markets in several countries through established depository and custodial relationships. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have established an electronic bridge between their two systems across which their respective participants may settle trades with each other. Euroclear is incorporated under the laws of Belgium and Clearstream, Luxembourg is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. If Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is the depository for a global security and there is no depository in the United States, you will not be able to hold interests in that global security through any securities clearing system in the United States. Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those clearing systems or their participants, and we take no responsibility for their activities. Those clearing systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the securities through these clearing systems and wish to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, on a particular day may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Brussels or Luxembourg, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. as nominee of CDS, for the benefit of owners of beneficial interests in the global notes, including participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. No person other than the registered holder of the global notes will have any claim against us in respect of any payments due on the global notes. CDS is Canada\'s national securities clearing and depositary services organization. CDS is headquartered in Toronto and has offices in Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver. CDS is a subsidiary of The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, part of TMX Group Limited. Cross-market transfers of Canadian notes between persons holding directly or indirectly through CDS participants, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, on the other, will be effected in CDS in accordance with CDS rules; however, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant clearing system by the counterparty in that system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions directly to CDS or to the Canadian Subcustodians. We do not recognize this type of investor or any intermediary as a holder of securities. Instead, we deal only with the depository that holds the global security. There may be more than one financial intermediary in the chain of ownership for an investor. We do not monitor and are not responsible for the policies or actions or records of ownership interests of any of those intermediaries. The following discussion is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This section constitutes the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Sidley Austin LLP, United States tax counsel to Bank of America Corporation. This summary also does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a particular holder. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, or common stock offered in this prospectus, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and accordingly, this summary does not apply to partnerships. Accordingly, you should also consult the applicable supplement for any additional discussion of U.S. federal taxation with respect to the specific debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock offered thereunder. Consequences to U.S. Holders\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S. Holders of debt securities. Thus, a U.S. Holder may be required to include OID in income in advance of the receipt of some or all of the related cash payments. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the OID debt security, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. Holder generally must include the de minimis OID in income at the time payments, other than qualified stated interest, on the debt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid (unless the U.S. Holder makes the election described below under ""-Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount""). Any amount of de minimis OID that is included in income in this manner will be treated as capital gain. In the case of a debt security that is a variable rate debt security, special rules apply. Any payment, other than qualified stated interest, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a debt security with market discount generally will be treated as ordinary interest income to the extent of the market discount not previously included in income that accrued on the debt security during such holder\'s holding period. A U.S. Holder may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues (on either a straight-line or constant yield basis), in lieu of treating a portion of any gain realized on a sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of the debt security as ordinary income. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors before making this election. ""\nWe expect that certain debt securities will trade in the secondary market with accrued interest. Some of our debt securities may be issued with maturities of one year or less from the date of issue (after taking into account the last possible date that the debt security could be outstanding under its terms), which we refer to as short-term debt securities. Any gain in excess of this amount will be treated as short-term capital gain. Acquisition discount is the excess of the remaining redemption amount of the short-term debt security at the time of acquisition over the purchase price. Net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. The ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code. Debt securities containing these features may be characterized as ""contingent payment debt instruments"" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A ""projected payment schedule"" with respect to a debt security generally is a series of projected payments, the amount and timing of which would produce a yield to maturity on that debt security equal to the comparable yield. For any subsequent accrual period, the adjusted issue price will be (i) the sum of the issue price of the debt security and any interest previously accrued on the debt security by a holder (without regard to any positive or negative adjustments, described below) minus (ii) the amount of any projected payments on the debt security for previous accrual periods. A positive adjustment is the excess of actual payments in respect of contingent payments over the projected amount of contingent payments. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment (including an amount payable at maturity) will be treated as fixed if (and when) all remaining contingencies with respect to it are remote or incidental within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. The comparable yield will be determined based upon market conditions as of the date of the applicable supplement. The comparable yield is likely to change between the date of any preliminary supplement and the date of the related final supplement. Therefore, the projected payment schedule included in any preliminary supplement will be subject to change. We will determine the actual projected payment schedule and the actual comparable yield on the pricing date. 132\nTable of Contents\nNon-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Securities. The above election will apply to all other debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and the election may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of such debt security, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). Amortizable bond premium on a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be computed in the applicable foreign currency. If a U.S. Holder does not elect to amortize bond premium, the bond premium computed in the foreign currency must be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the maturity date and such bond premium will constitute a capital loss which may be offset or eliminated by foreign currency exchange gain. If, however, a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security is traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash basis method of tax accounting, the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized will be determined by translating the foreign currency payment at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. This election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Net long-term\n134\nTable of Contents\ncapital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. Certain U.S. Holders, including individuals, estates and trusts, are subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on unearned income. Investment income generally includes passive income such as interest and capital gains. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting from an investment in the debt securities. In addition, special rules may apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S. Holders that are entities rather than individuals. An individual Non-U.S. Holder who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale, exchange, or other disposition of a debt security, provided that certain other conditions are met, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the gain realized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of such debt security. Income Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business within the United States\n. Non-U.S.\nHolders should read the material under the heading ""- Consequences to U.S. Holders"" for a description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of debt securities. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than certain exempt holders, we and other payors are required to report to the IRS all payments of principal, any premium, and interest on the debt security, and the accrual of OID on an OID debt security. Additionally, backup withholding generally will apply to any payments, including payments of OID, if a U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number and certify that the taxpayer identification number is correct, the U.S. Holder is notified by the IRS that it has failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns or a U.S. Holder does not certify that it has not underreported its interest and dividend income. Distributions on Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and Depositary Shares. In determining whether a dividend paid on stock is an extraordinary dividend, a corporate U.S. Holder may elect to substitute the fair market value of the stock for its tax basis for purposes of applying these tests if the fair market value as of the day before the ex-dividend date is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury. Any part of the nontaxed portion of an extraordinary dividend that is not applied to reduce the corporate U.S. Holder\'s tax basis as a result of the limitation on reducing its basis below zero would be treated as gain from the disposition of such stock and would be recognized in the taxable year in which the extraordinary dividend is received. 139\nTable of Contents\nSale, Exchange, or other Taxable Disposition. Redemption or Repurchase of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, or Depositary Shares\n. Special rules apply if we redeem our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares for our debt securities. 140\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income\n. Convertible Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to certain other of our equity securities, including preferred stock convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock or\n142\nTable of Contents\nother securities. The material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to these securities will be discussed in the applicable supplement. Taxation of Units\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of any special U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of units that we are offering, including any tax considerations relating to the specific terms of the units. In addition, ""material\n143\nTable of Contents\nadvisors"" with respect to such a transaction may be required to file returns and maintain records, including lists identifying investors in the transactions, and to furnish those records to the IRS upon demand. Under certain circumstances, a holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. 144\nTable of Contents\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\nWe may sell the securities offered under this prospectus:\nthrough underwriters;\nthrough dealers;\nthrough agents; or\ndirectly to purchasers. Distribution Through Underwriters\nWe may offer and sell securities from time to time to one or more underwriters who would purchase the securities as principal for resale to the public, either on a firm commitment or best efforts basis. The underwriters also may receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. We will set forth the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction in the applicable supplement. Securities may be sold in connection with a remarketing after their purchase by one or more firms including our affiliates, acting as principal for their own accounts or as our agent. Those activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Ordinarily, each issue of securities will be a new issue, and there will be no established trading market for any security other than our common stock prior to its original issue date. We may not list any particular series of securities on a securities exchange or quotation system. Any underwriters to whom or agents through whom the offered securities are sold for offering and sale may make a market in the offered securities. We cannot assure you that there will be a liquid trading market for the offered securities. We may pay the standby underwriters a commitment fee for the securities they commit to purchase on a standby basis. In the applicable supplement, we will specify the settlement period for the offered securities. Market-Making Transactions by Affiliates\nFollowing the initial distribution of securities, our broker-dealer affiliates, including MLPF&S, may buy and sell the securities in secondary market transactions as part of their business as broker-dealers. Our affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions. Unless we or our agent inform you in your confirmation of sale that the security is being purchased in its original offering and sale, you may assume that you are purchasing the security in a market-making transaction. 148\nTable of Contents\nERISA CONSIDERATIONS\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (""ERISA""), should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the ERISA plan\'s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the offered securities of Bank of America. A fiduciary should also consider whether an investment in the offered securities may constitute a ""prohibited transaction,"" as described below. As a result, a prohibited transaction may arise if the securities are acquired by or on behalf of a plan unless those securities are acquired and held pursuant to an available exemption. Additionally, transactions involving those assets undertaken by such service providers or fiduciaries could be deemed prohibited transactions under ERISA or the Code. Those class exemptions are PTCE 96-23 (for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company separate accounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers).

The company has furloughed employees across the nation because of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on business. Staff from the Employment Security Department local rapid response team and WorkSource center will perform outreach to employees of Cox to ease the transition.', 'More than two months into the pandemic, the racetrack is quiet and the stands are empty. Thousands of unused Enterprise rental cars are now parked there. So is Filet of Chicken, a local poultry processor, selling meat from refrigerated trucks. When they were not stuck in traffic, they flocked to venues like the Speedway to watch others race. Car dealerships and service shops saw upwards of half their revenues evaporate as lockdowns began in mid-March. Things are slowly starting to improve, according to local business owners interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but the prospect of a long-term economic downturn has some experts predicting the car industry will look much different once the pandemic is over. Manufacturers shuttered factories or shifted to making personal protective equipment. Price also runs the machine in the office before he locks up for the evening. But Wojohn found a niche at senior living facilities, with his valets acting as liaisons between delivery men, outside visitors and the staff.

However, it is also critical for analytics companies to focus on the employees that have survived the downsizing of the company. Alongside, a mass layoff can reduce the employee trust on the organisation, and its leaders which is again essential for businesses to work productively amid this crisis. A study has revealed that approximately 74% of the employees that have survived the mass layoff amid COVID-19 would witness a massive decline in their work productivity, which, in turn, can deteriorate the company’s product and service lines. For this, business leaders should encourage their employees to upskill/reskill themselves in order to keep up their relevance amid COVID-19. Post the layoffs, the remaining employees become a critical asset for companies, and therefore business leaders must take necessary steps to ensure their job satisfaction. Therefore, business leaders must address this need and provide them access to the required tools and platforms in order to execute their daily work.

Just prior to Raemdonck taking the reins in 2018, Neiman’s sustained a couple of difficult years financially under then CEO Karen Katz, who’d run the company since 2010. Sales were flagging for many department stores, including Neiman Marcus. But Katz also pointed to a 2016 plunge in oil prices as adding to the difficulties, since the finances of so many Neiman’s customers in Dallas and Houston—home to the flagship and two of its three largest stores—were closely tied to the fortunes of the oil industry. But in March 2019 the company bought itself a little more time. Initially announced as a 250,000-square-foot project, the Neiman Marcus at Hudson Yards was 60,000 square feet smaller when it opened in March 2019. Touch-screen digital directories throughout the store enable easy product searches. Another characteristic of the Hudson Yards space is more of a throwback. It wasn’t long before the elegant space became the de rigueur dining spot for the city’s ladies who lunch and made Neiman Marcus nearly as well-known for its popovers paired with strawberry butter as for its selection of clothing and accessories downstairs. Models could also roam the restaurant showing off new fashions. Customers can drop off items to be appraised and sold through the website, in one of several pilots the company is running with Fashionphile, including at NorthPark. It’s a strategy that some Neiman’s competitors, like Saks and Nordstrom, are also increasingly adopting in the face of falling revenue and a new generation of online-savvy consumers who don’t typically shop in department stores. Texas people are very, very proud of our tried-and-true staples. Not only does that sizable portrait of Mr. Stanley greet you at the entrance, but moving about much of the store feels like stepping back into its fifties or sixties heyday. It’s a difference that’s all the more noticeable if you cross the street to Forty Five Ten, the luxury retailer that relocated from Dallas’s McKinney Avenue in 2016 and is Neiman’s first direct competitor downtown since the old Sanger-Harris shuttered in 1990. Neiman Marcus furloughed its workers, while Forty Five Ten started laying people off. Neiman’s was at least able to continue selling online—albeit at deep-discount prices—while Forty Five Ten shuttered even its e-commerce operation. Katz was also in charge when the company formed the Innovation Lab that oversaw the development of tools like the Memory Mirror, which allows customers to record and download videos of in-store beauty tutorials, and the iSell app. Another of the initiatives that van Raemdonck has championed was likewise in the works before he arrived. A small number of frequent online customers were invited to use the service. On top of that, the tool factors in the behavior of others with similar buying patterns. It’s all probably an improvement over the old binders of client info—or at least a good online proxy for them. But, van Raemdonck’s description of the tool as “state-of-the-art” aside, it’s doesn’t sound all that different than the sort of algorithm-driven recommendations today’s digital consumers encounter all the time in using Netflix or Amazon. “ If only there were exponentially more demand for $850,000 alligator coats, Neiman’s indeed might have found its path to recovery. Gone is Jim Gold, president and chief merchandising officer, also after 28 years—replaced by Lana Todorovich, like van Raemdonck a veteran of Ralph Lauren. Another key departure has been Scott Emmons, who left in December 2018 after twelve years. There has to be something magical that’s happening inside those four walls to get people to come.” Among those experts is Robert Sakowitz, who ran his family’s Houston-based chain of high-end specialty stores—directly competing with the likes of Neiman Marcus—for nearly thirty years, until the eighties’ Texas oil bust proved to be its undoing. Two of its Texas distribution centers, in Irving and Longview, were to be sold as well. Then it reportedly missed a mid-April interest payment on its debt. Yes, department stores and the retail sector as a whole have fared poorly in recent years. Its problem was a single poorly timed and ill-conceived financial transaction that hamstrung its every move from then on.']",71.03488364498068,

In recent remarks, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs reflected on the retailer\'s expectations in the early months of the year. Americans stayed home for weeks during shelter-in-place orders. Consumers filled up their shopping carts, jockeyed for grocery delivery slots and cleared shelves of staples, from hand sanitizer and toilet paper to ground beef, rice and beans. The pandemic has altered not only their financial outlook for the year but their long-term direction. That\'s led to investment and expansion of contactless checkout approaches — particularly by grocery stores. In the U.S., over the course of 2020, almost 36% of online nonfood spending will be supported by physical stores, according to research by GlobalData. Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe\'s have seen sales soar as many consumers skipped the mall and shopped at the big-box store or website instead. And even sales in specific categories illuminate that contrast. The poor are forced to cut back even more, with some entirely reliant upon unemployment benefits that are running out. "" But it\'s not just about income right now, it\'s whether or not you have a job."" Positives include personal savings trending at 18[%] to 19%. ... Deloitte estimates sales during the November-to-January time frame will rise between 1% and 1.5%, amounting to between $1.147 trillion and $1.152 trillion, compared with growth of 4.1% in 2019. But lost sales from weeks of shuttered storefronts made the slog even more challenging. Dozens, including Brooks Brothers, J.C. Penney and J.Crew, have wound up in bankruptcy court in 2020. Some of these names plan to close hundreds of stores, as they restructure their business. As more and more stores go dark at the mall, some major retail executives are looking to grow outside of it — a tactic they hadn\'t touted so publicly before.

To many traders, including myself, a much higher priced CHK stock via a reverse stock split would them make much more willing to short CHK than shorting a penny stock.

While Anschutz did not buy their assets, he did greatly increase his holdings in the PRB area. The announcement of a large asset purchase instead of an asset sale to reduce debt/leverage made me very bearish. While some out of court restructuring plans may be floated by various stakeholders in the near future, the reality is that they just have too much debt and energy prices are too low to generate cash flow to pay interest and to pay CAPEX to maintain production.

Prior to the bankruptcy, Kamensky had taken legal action against the department store’s owners, Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, accusing them of plundering Neiman Marcus for money when it couldn’t pay back its debts.

Depending on how the situation unfolds in the next months and years, the fact that there’s a concrete date for Apple’s self-driving car plans could indicate the company is making a fundamental change to its product-development strategy. But until recent years, they were only limited to academic and military research labs and science contests. We’re finally seeing cars that can drive themselves in real streets. Apple has been doing autonomous driving research under the title “Project Titan” since 2014. The initial goal was reportedly for Apple to create a car from scratch. In 2016, the company shifted focus and aimed at developing software for self-driving cars. The history of Project Titan indicates that Apple has always maintained interest in self-driving cars, but there were never signs of a plan to launch a product. Apple is usually not a first mover, but it certainly knows when to enter a new market. Tesla offers a fully autonomous autopilot feature but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel when it is enabled. Unlike other sectors that Apple has conquered, self-driving cars are heavy on artificial intelligence and warrant a different development strategy. Tesla, on the other hand, has directly collected its data from the hundreds of thousands of cars it has sold to consumers. According to Reuters’ report, Apple aims to build “a vehicle for consumers.” For its self-driving car, Apple will be using its own lidars and partner with other manufacturers. According to the Reuters report, Apple is looking to outsource the manufacturing of the car, which would be in contrast to the company’s preference to maintain full control over its product stack.

However, it does bode well for future volumes and perhaps pricing upon renewals. Yet even if this happens, it could be a positive for long-term Crestwood unitholders. What's more, management still forecasts $290 million to $340 million in distributable cash flow, which, at the midpoint of guidance, would still equal about $4.25 per unit, handily covering the $2.50 annual dividend. Remember, Crestwood isn't an oil and gas producer, but rather a transporter. Meanwhile, storage is scarce, so Crestwood's storage assets should also add to revenue and cash flows this year.

News of the merger push comes as several struggling businesses are fighting to survive the impacts of being closed during the outbreak. Representatives for Mudrick, Neiman Marcus and HBC declined to comment. The lenders hold the lion’s share of Neiman Marcus’s senior debt, giving them significant sway over whether the company’s reorganization plan is approved.

(', '(CNN) — In addition to the coronavirus pandemic, the oil crash could be disastrous for overleveraged shale oil companies. The downturn in the oil industry has laid bare just how much of America’s rise to superpower status in the energy world was made possible by easy money. Getting locked out of the junk bond market will tip the weakest players into bankruptcy, risking countless US jobs along the way. “These companies were in trouble before COVID-19 happened,” John Kempf, senior director at Fitch Ratings, told CNN Business. “ After 2015 and 2016, they never really got their balance sheets back together. Diamond Offshore Drilling joined the bankruptcy club on Sunday. California Resources, another oil company flagged by Fitch as a potential default, has suffered a 76% drop in its stock this year. Moreover, there is investor fatigue given that the energy industry has struggled for years. Analysts said oil companies with sturdy investment grade credit ratings will likely have access to these emergency funds. But it’s not clear whether junk-rated shale oil companies will get access to the funds they need to survive because of their shaky financial conditions.', '• The US shale revolution that propelled the country to energy dominance was backed in large part by private-equity firms. • Small to midsize firms that specialize in oil and gas will have trouble raising funds in the future, while larger firms with diverse portfolios will be shielded, according to nearly a dozen experts. Extracting oil from a shale formation is not like puncturing a pressurized juice box with a straw. ""That\'s problematic for [private equity firms] because they want to invest as little capital in them as possible,"" Aitken said. But if the state of private equity was bad going into this year, the pandemic-fueled collapse of oil markets — which at times saw prices for certain futures contracts sink to the negative double-digits — has only made it worse. And for some of the biggest companies, it\'s no longer a hypothetical. Lime Rock and Quantum Energy Partners declined to comment on the record. In a statement, Riverstone said it has expanded its investments over the past decade to areas outside of oil and gas, including renewable energy, such as wind, solar, and biomass, where ""demand is very strong and accelerating."" ""To an extent, private-equity firms have the ability to be patient,"" Freeman said.

Roy Cooper has limited indoor gatherings to 10 people since early November, and outdoor gatherings have been limited to 50 since early October.

Four delivery trays of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were pulled back from delivery to California and Alabama this week and sent back to the company because they were colder than anticipated, according to Gustave Perna, the army general who serves as Operation Warp Speed’s chief operations officer. Each of the trays can likely be used to vaccinate 975 people. These trays were found to be much colder, according to Perna. Alex Azar, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, acknowledged production challenges that have been previously disclosed by Pfizer. An existing limit on group gatherings remains, with a maximum of five people from two households allowed to meet. That rule is however to be relaxed from Dec. 24-26 to allow close families to celebrate Christmas together. While restaurants can still serve food for customers to take away and eat at home, alcohol has now been banned in public, putting an end to the popular makeshift mulled wine stalls. The use of fireworks is also being heavily restricted, in part to lighten the load on hospitals, which are already filling up with COVID-19 patients. “I don’t think we’ve ever been more excited or energized about our prospects,” PayPal finance chief John Rainey said on a November conference call.

Many suspended payments to investors and vowed not to hold layoffs. Salesforce, Cisco Systems and PayPal cut staff even after their chief executives vowed not to do so.

In other words, all four malls are anchored by failed or flagging chain department stores. When anchor stores go dark or more than 20% of the mall is empty and foot traffic dwindles, the leases of other tenants commonly include provisions entitling them to lower rents as well as options to terminate their leases, leaving mall owners with less income and empty space.

In the early days of Amazon, the servers that the company used required so much power that Bezos and his wife couldn\'t run a hair dryer or a vacuum in the house without blowing a fuse. They would bring their friends and family and would often sleep in their cars before going to work the next day. After that, Amazon vowed that it would never have a shortage of labor to meet demand for the holidays again, which is why Amazon hires so many seasonal workers today.

Penney Co and Saks Fifth Avenue, reported for duty at some Texas-based shops Friday, selling products “to-go” for orders placed online. For over a month, “non-essential” stores have been shut to the public to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, and many have been limited to shipping online orders to prospects’ homes. Even with curbside service, chains have sharply curtailed signature department store services.', 'Known for his cinema verité explorations of American institutions, the documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman trained his camera on Dallas’s flagship Neiman Marcus location in 1982. And the things that are most important for us here are our hands—so we can punch the tickets in the cash register—and smiles. Since 2013, the sales associates have been armed with smartphones on which a proprietary application called iSell, developed by the company’s in-house Innovation Lab, provides them the sort of information about their customers that they previously had to haul around in thick binders or print out on register receipts. Dressed in an animal-print jacket over a black top, Hardin pulled out her phone and hunched slightly over it. If a customer came in February, bought a skirt and a jacket and a sweater, and then in April says, ‘I really need another piece to go with that,’ the associate can go and look at the purchase history in the app so they can round out the sale,” she explained. Total sales at department stores nationwide have plunged 36 percent since their peak in 2001. They expressed confidence that these digital-age efforts would improve the ease and profitability of each sale. Reestablishing that as a priority today could help set Neiman’s apart again. There were regular interest payments to keep up with, too, not to mention the need for additional cash to support investments necessary to better compete in the digital age. Mullen wore a lacy black sweater over gray jeans and a pair of black ankle boots. Van Raemdonck hired Mullen away from Boston Consulting Group, where he got his own start in business, in 2018. The first shop was opened in 1907 in downtown Dallas by Herbert Marcus, his sister Carrie, and her husband Al Neiman. By then, Herbert’s eldest son, Stanley, had joined the family business. His creation of the Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion lured the likes of Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent to visit Texas. There was a right customer for every piece of merchandise, and that part of a merchant’s job was not only to bring the two together, but also to prevent the customer from making the wrong choice,” he wrote. “ By 1968, Neiman Marcus was operating four stores, all of them in Texas. Stanley determined that the company needed a larger partner capable of funding a national expansion. He and the board of directors settled upon a merger with the West Coast department store operator Broadway-Hale that largely left the Marcus family in control of Neiman’s operations. Walk in the entrance nearest the corner of Main and Ervay in the downtown Dallas flagship store, and you’ll encounter a large black-and-white portrait of Marcus, bald and besuited with a salt-and-pepper beard. Having Stanley in my office was super important because that’s where the formula was created,” he said. “ That formula, he said, was about forging a “relationship of love” with customers. “ Still, the company weathered those times while investing in its discount Last Call outlets and developing its online business. Just prior to Raemdonck taking the reins in 2018, Neiman’s sustained a couple of difficult years financially under then CEO Karen Katz, who’d run the company since 2010. Sales were flagging for many department stores, including Neiman Marcus. But Katz also pointed to a 2016 plunge in oil prices as adding to the difficulties, since the finances of so many Neiman’s customers in Dallas and Houston—home to the flagship and two of its three largest stores—were closely tied to the fortunes of the oil industry. But in March 2019 the company bought itself a little more time. Initially announced as a 250,000-square-foot project, the Neiman Marcus at Hudson Yards was 60,000 square feet smaller when it opened in March 2019. Touch-screen digital directories throughout the store enable easy product searches. Another characteristic of the Hudson Yards space is more of a throwback. It wasn’t long before the elegant space became the de rigueur dining spot for the city’s ladies who lunch and made Neiman Marcus nearly as well-known for its popovers paired with strawberry butter as for its selection of clothing and accessories downstairs. Models could also roam the restaurant showing off new fashions. Customers can drop off items to be appraised and sold through the website, in one of several pilots the company is running with Fashionphile, including at NorthPark. It’s a strategy that some Neiman’s competitors, like Saks and Nordstrom, are also increasingly adopting in the face of falling revenue and a new generation of online-savvy consumers who don’t typically shop in department stores. Texas people are very, very proud of our tried-and-true staples. Not only does that sizable portrait of Mr. Stanley greet you at the entrance, but moving about much of the store feels like stepping back into its fifties or sixties heyday. It’s a difference that’s all the more noticeable if you cross the street to Forty Five Ten, the luxury retailer that relocated from Dallas’s McKinney Avenue in 2016 and is Neiman’s first direct competitor downtown since the old Sanger-Harris shuttered in 1990. Neiman Marcus furloughed its workers, while Forty Five Ten started laying people off. Neiman’s was at least able to continue selling online—albeit at deep-discount prices—while Forty Five Ten shuttered even its e-commerce operation. Katz was also in charge when the company formed the Innovation Lab that oversaw the development of tools like the Memory Mirror, which allows customers to record and download videos of in-store beauty tutorials, and the iSell app. Another of the initiatives that van Raemdonck has championed was likewise in the works before he arrived. A small number of frequent online customers were invited to use the service. On top of that, the tool factors in the behavior of others with similar buying patterns. It’s all probably an improvement over the old binders of client info—or at least a good online proxy for them. But, van Raemdonck’s description of the tool as “state-of-the-art” aside, it’s doesn’t sound all that different than the sort of algorithm-driven recommendations today’s digital consumers encounter all the time in using Netflix or Amazon. “ If only there were exponentially more demand for $850,000 alligator coats, Neiman’s indeed might have found its path to recovery. Gone is Jim Gold, president and chief merchandising officer, also after 28 years—replaced by Lana Todorovich, like van Raemdonck a veteran of Ralph Lauren. Another key departure has been Scott Emmons, who left in December 2018 after twelve years. There has to be something magical that’s happening inside those four walls to get people to come.” Among those experts is Robert Sakowitz, who ran his family’s Houston-based chain of high-end specialty stores—directly competing with the likes of Neiman Marcus—for nearly thirty years, until the eighties’ Texas oil bust proved to be its undoing. Two of its Texas distribution centers, in Irving and Longview, were to be sold as well. Then it reportedly missed a mid-April interest payment on its debt. Yes, department stores and the retail sector as a whole have fared poorly in recent years. Its problem was a single poorly timed and ill-conceived financial transaction that hamstrung its every move from then on.']",17.870789002300196,

Several other companies launched their own initiatives to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “I’d like to start by saying that I’ve read and taken in the raw and personal accounts of Black women and women of color regarding their experiences inside our company at Refinery29,” Barberich wrote on Instagram. “ And so I will be stepping aside in my role at R29 to help diversify our leadership in editorial and ensure this brand and the people it touches can spark a new defining chapter.” The resignation comes as Vice Media Group has launched an external investigation into the workplace culture at Refinery29. Controversy also hit Condé Nast’s Bon Appétit, where editor in chief Adam Rapoport resigned after a photograph of him in brown face emerged amid allegations of a racist work environment. At Essence Magazine, chief executive officer Richelieu Dennis stepped down on July 1 after the company launched an investigation into allegations of a toxic work culture for Black women. Nasr succeeded Glenda Bailey, who announced her resignation in January after a 19-year tenure. The design duo is set to show their first joint collection in September for the spring 2021 season. Because social-distancing guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic have prohibited large gatherings, many fashion week events have subsequently been canceled this year. Earlier in July, IMG, which owns and operates NYFW: The Shows, sent out a fashion week deck to designers to see if they were interested in presenting collections during fashion week.']",89.50848431277547,

But until recent years, they were only limited to academic and military research labs and science contests. We’re finally seeing cars that can drive themselves in real streets. Apple has been doing autonomous driving research under the title “Project Titan” since 2014. The initial goal was reportedly for Apple to create a car from scratch. In 2016, the company shifted focus and aimed at developing software for self-driving cars. The history of Project Titan indicates that Apple has always maintained interest in self-driving cars, but there were never signs of a plan to launch a product. Apple is usually not a first mover, but it certainly knows when to enter a new market. Tesla offers a fully autonomous autopilot feature but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel when it is enabled. Unlike other sectors that Apple has conquered, self-driving cars are heavy on artificial intelligence and warrant a different development strategy. Tesla, on the other hand, has directly collected its data from the hundreds of thousands of cars it has sold to consumers. According to Reuters’ report, Apple aims to build “a vehicle for consumers.” For its self-driving car, Apple will be using its own lidars and partner with other manufacturers. According to the Reuters report, Apple is looking to outsource the manufacturing of the car, which would be in contrast to the company’s preference to maintain full control over its product stack.

The Covid-19 pandemic hitting in March made things much worse. Across the US, department stores are shrinking or shuttering altogether. In 2011, US department stores employed 1.2 million employees across 8,600 stores, according to estimates from the research firm IBISWorld. All the while, department stores’ contraction is upending local labor markets and the communities they called home. Department store employees also had it pretty good, for a time. The sector was welcoming to women salespeople, providing a path to certain corporate roles for those who found success, according to the book From Main Street to Mall: The Rise and Fall of the American Department Store. Meanwhile, many department store chains made the wrong bets, investing more heavily in store expansion while underinvesting in merchandise differentiation and e-commerce strategies. But perhaps most critically for the chains targeting the middle class — think Macy’s, JC Penney, and Bon-Ton — this category of households has been struggling since the Great Recession began in 2007. In addition to Sears and JC Penney, higher-end stores Barneys New York, Lord & Taylor, and Neiman Marcus have all filed for bankruptcy in the past two years. Even Nordstrom, viewed by industry insiders as the most progressive traditional department store chain, is facing significant headwinds. For a while, department stores still could provide a way to reach mostly older consumers who preferred in-person shopping or others who didn’t have internet access, but the chains became more complementary for popular brands rather than remaining a crucial sales channel. The Dallas-based luxury chain filed for bankruptcy earlier this year under crushing debt from its PE owner. And the communities they call home, which experienced the upside of their presence during the golden years, are now faced with a series of cascading challenges. Taxable physical retail sales dropped in 2015 and 2016 in Bartlesville but grew modestly in 2018 and 2019. Of course, department store jobs are different from discount chain jobs, which have lower average hourly pay and rarely offer sales commissions. In Madison, Wisconsin, local city-planning officials are looking ahead to a possible future where their city won’t have malls anchored by department stores. Madison officials have been studying other mall redevelopment plans around the country for ideas about what to do. Another challenge involves restructuring the public street network around malls. It creates this vicious cycle and then you can’t recruit good employees. In the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, more started working in discount chains. That may not be a great thing, as least as it relates to employee earnings. And Dollar General’s stock price hit an all-time high in October; the company is now worth nearly $53 billion. At the weakest moment for department stores, Amazon is becoming a more powerful direct competitor. 2 Canada — and too many subpar malls, considering current shopping trends. But the communities across the country that depended on these stores and malls as job creators will have to get creative to rebuild around their ruins. Even if you could snap your fingers and return this retail sector to glory, it wouldn’t solve the key societal and macroeconomic problems connected to its decline.']",68.70919553894144,

COVID-19 has triggered a short-term liquidity crisis for many firms that had modest leverage prior to the crisis but are now experiencing sharp declines in revenue. Each category — shocked-but-sound, overlevered and zombies — raises distinct valuation questions in a Chapter 11 case. We start first with these common challenges and then turn to category-specific issues. What is different during this crisis is the uncertainty surrounding these building blocks. What is different in bankruptcy is that the investor waterfall — senior creditors, junior creditors and shareholders — often erupts into sharp disagreements about how to measure these building blocks. These disagreements are resolved by bankruptcy judges who typically have little to no ability to conduct their own, independent valuations.[13]Put differently, the uncertainties that exist outside of bankruptcy, which are large in the current crisis, are magnified in bankruptcy as investors fight to increase their recoveries. Upstream, firms may find that supply chains have been disrupted by COVID-19. This will be particularly true for businesses that rely on inputs sourced abroad. The flashpoint in a surprisingly large percentage of bankruptcy valuations is the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, used as the discount rate, not the projected free cash flows.[14] Experts are much more likely to challenge each other\'s estimates of the WACC, including inputs such as the cost of equity and beta, than they are to challenge the projected cash flows, which were often prepared by the firm\'s own managers. In these cases, a valuation expert is often tasked with estimating the cost of equity going forward. While the current environment puts these issues in stark relief, they are actually questions that have been studied by financial economists for many years. The months ahead are likely to unveil an unprecedented wave of Chapter 11 filings by many corporations. Chris Isidore, ""Hertz files for bankruptcy,"" CNN , May 24, 2020.

The April report said the unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher -- or approaching 20%. If you adjust the figures for the misclassification detailed above, the true number of unemployed is closer to 26 million or 27 million, according to Nick Bunker, an economic research director for the jobs website Indeed. Yet, if people aren’t searching for work, the BLS doesn’t typically count them as unemployed -- instead they’re considered “not in labor force,” with such outsiders still numbering 6.7 million people more than before the pandemic. Another potential culprit is that many of the self-employed and gig workers who are out of work and on the new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits -- 10.7 million people as of the week ended May 16 -- are being classified as something other than unemployed, according to Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist and former U.S. Labor Department chief economist. But given the drop in unemployment and the numbers that the BLS survey is capturing, my guess is that many of the 10.7 million were not counted as unemployed.” In fact, a Federal Reserve research paper from 2019 found that pooling the BLS payroll numbers and a series derived from ADP could come closer to the true state of employment.', 'On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.4% on Wednesday to 3,122.87.

The attention to its planned payments to executives comes at a time when the retailer faces another key hearing next week on a disclosure statement for its Chapter 11 plan. The purpose of a disclosure statement is essentially to assure the court that when creditors are asked to vote on a plan of reorganization, they have adequate information to do so. Unsecured creditors, including vendors, typically stand to recover a mere fraction of what they are owed. In the Neiman Marcus bankruptcy, unsecured creditors have been eyeing possible lawsuits related to the Mytheresa transfer as one potential source of recoveries. The dispute over Neiman’s Chapter 11 plan, which will be a subject of a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, has involved concerns raised by creditors about how a plan by the retailer would prevent them from pursuing suits related to the Mytheresa transfer, and essentially block off a path to recoveries. The committee’s goal in general is to ensure that creditors are able to pursue recoveries for their claims.', 'Those of us who grew up during the Depression years lived during some tough times, but that helped us deal with many problems that life has thrown our way.

Senate Republicans, who are expected to release their proposal this week, are generally loath to extend the full benefit. Democrats, on the other hand, want to continue the bigger benefit into 2021. Many are using it to cover their rent or mortgage, buy food and spend on other basic needs.

The Vessel public art sculpture – likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists – was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base. The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed; the 1987 stock market crash; the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks; and the 2008 financial crisis – not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power outages. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. Carl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different. September 11th was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system. Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. “There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “ In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers – including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley – have announced they will require less office space in the future. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine. Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.” Will it be a constructive force that brings reform – or a divisive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?', 'JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, and other household names have recently filed headline-grabbing Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases.

Numerous sources claim that pre-owned luxury could in fact overtake the traditional luxury market, and the pandemic economy could very well be a tipping point.

Struggling retailers attempting to fight the uphill battle may react by over-discounting, offering huge ecommerce discounts to consumers to spur demand. When a business is financially troubled, the solution usually goes to Economics 101 — if the brand lowers prices, theoretically demand will go up. At some point in the past few years it determined its problem was pricing, so it switched to an everyday low-price model, thereby eliminating discounts and coupons in hopes a one-size-fits-all approach would save the company. The same goes for J. Crew, which shifted to fewer deals to try to attract the luxury shopper in the last few years.

Questrom was the first person outside the founding family to run Neiman Marcus. When he arrived, Penney was being talked about on Wall Street as a candidate for bankruptcy. Instead, the stock price appreciated from just under $10 to $45 a share during his tenure. Questrom says he’s giving Penney a 50-50 chance of emerging with the company intact, and he’s quick to emphasize that those odds are not the fault of Penney CEO Jill Soltau. Questrom believes leaders coming in should bring in a few select people. But those newbies have to learn from the veterans and appreciate the culture. He summed up 2011-13, CEO Ron Johnson’s tenure and a destructive time for Penney that it has been clawing back from ever since. “ And Home Depot veteran Marvin Ellison “wasn’t the right person for the job,” Questrom said, and taking Penney into the major appliance business set it back. “ He’d rather see it come out of bankruptcy with its organization intact.

According to one analysis by Oxfam, 17 out of the top 25 most profitable U.S. corporations -- including Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, Pfizer and Visa -- are projected to rake in $85 billion more in 2020 than in previous years as upward of 40 million Americans are out of work. As I've illustrated all summer long, we live in a bloody state of anarchotyranny. --Manufacturing giant 3M slashed 1,500 jobs at the beginning of the month. --Hundreds of health care workers have been laid off in Cook County, Illinois, Cape Cod, the University of Texas Medical Branch Health system, Lynwood Hospital in Los Angeles and Minnesota's state hospital system.

Since those early days at Harvard, Facebook has captured the hearts, minds, and clicks of billions, in the process gaining immense control over the world’s information. Thus far, users have embraced this system, feeding it with data and dollars. And it fundamentally changed how people used the website: the users who had gone to bed with an audience of a few woke up with a potential audience of thousands. “ But Facebook soon ran into a problem: as the network grew, the digital trickle risked becoming a tsunami. To deal with this glut of information, Facebook increasingly turned to algorithms to curate the feed, selecting what it thought users wanted to see. And, fittingly enough, one of the most important parts of News Feed came from its moniker: news. Writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, Mathew Ingram attributed this to Facebook’s efforts to “move the goalposts” of its “all-powerful (and completely mysterious) algorithm.” Facebook once again presented a philosophical mandate: As a company press release declared, “Journalism plays a critical role in our democracy. When news is deeply-reported and well-sourced it gives people information they can rely on. The initial selection of publishers was determined by surveying what users wanted. As part of the initial launch and planned expansions into video and opinion, Facebook has yet to bring several of the most popular leftist outlets on board, including Jacobin, Current Affairs, In These Times, and The Young Turks, representatives of those publications confirmed to the HPR — some of whom said they would likely participate if asked. Whether such exclusions are flukes or examples of a broader problem is currently unclear. Regardless of whether Facebook’s vision of news is a logical evolution of the industry or an engineered outcome, it has very much taken hold. If Facebook had a history of interrogating its own power and constantly refining its approach, an announcement that perpetuated its control over the media ecosystem might be less cause for concern. But for its project to prove successful in the long run, Facebook needs to properly grapple with the critical questions that it faces. Because if it will not — or if it cannot — then users might begin to doubt the foundations upon which the kingdom stands.']",15.597761652391828,

In that event, third-party creditors of our subsidiaries would have additional assets from which to recover on their claims while holders of the notes would be structurally subordinated to creditors of our subsidiaries with respect to such assets. The value of the notes prior to stated maturity will be affected by interest rates at that time and a number of other factors, some of which are interrelated in complex ways. The effect of any one factor may be offset or magnified by the effect of another factor. Consequently, you should be willing to hold the notes to stated maturity. Our Ability To Service Our Debt, Including The Notes, May Be Limited By The Results Of Operations Of Our Subsidiaries And Certain Contractual Arrangements. We conduct substantially all of our activities and operations through our subsidiaries and are a separate and distinct legal entity from those subsidiaries. This subordination of creditors of a parent company to prior claims of creditors of its subsidiaries is commonly referred to as structural subordination. We are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry strategy, and the strategy reflected in our resolution plan submission is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of Wells Fargo, we entered into an intercompany support agreement with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of Wells Fargo (the “IHC\x94), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“WFBNA\x94), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS\x94), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS\x94) and certain of our other subsidiaries (the “Support Agreement\x94). Wells Fargo and the IHC’s respective obligations under the Support Agreement are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. The forgiveness of subordinated notes, termination of the committed line of credit or restrictions on dividend payments to us from our subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations, including any payments to holders of our debt securities (including the notes), and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by Wells Fargo at an earlier time that might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. It does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or if you are an investor subject to special rules, such as:\n\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. In the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the notes will be treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of the notes, provided that interest on the notes qualifies as “portfolio interest\x94 and is not subject to withholding under the “FATCA\x94 regime described below. Both U.S. and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of FATCA to the notes. The original offering price for such investors will not be less than $995.00 per note and will not be more than $1,000 per note. Wells Fargo Securities LLC will receive an agent discount of up to $5.00 per note, and from such agent discount will allow selected dealers a selling concession of up to $5.00 per note depending on market conditions that are relevant to the value of the notes at the time an order to purchase the notes is submitted to the agent. Dealers who purchase the notes for sales to eligible institutional investors and fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all selling concessions. The notes are not, and will not be, registered with any securities exchange or registry located outside of the United States and have not been registered with any non-U.S. securities or banking regulatory authority. Any person who wishes to acquire the notes from outside the United States should seek the advice or legal counsel as to the relevant requirements to acquire these notes. No application has been or will be made with the Argentine Comisión Nacional de Valores, the Argentine securities governmental authority, to offer the notes in Argentina. This document does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase, the notes in the republic of Chile, other than to individually identified buyers pursuant to a private offering within the meaning of Article 4 of the Ley de Mercado de Valores (an offer that is not addressed to the public at large or to a certain sector or specific group of the public). The notes have not been and will not be registered with the Superintendency of Securities Market of the Republic of Panama under Decree Law N°1 of July 8, 1999 (the “ \x94) and may not be publicly offered or sold within Panama, except in certain limited transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Panamanian Securities Act, including the private placement rule based on number 2 of Article 83 of Law Decree 1 of July 8, 1999 (or number 2 of Article 129 of the Unified Text of Law Decree 1 of July 8, 1999). The issuer is also not registered before the CNV or the BVPASA. Private securities of issuers not registered before the CNV may not have periodic financial information or audited financial statements, which could generate greater risk to the investor due to the asymmetry of information.']",18.228826500791676,

In many cases, these retailers were already in trouble already as Americans shopped increasingly online. But there’s no guarantee that customers will come flocking back to shop amid serious concerns about their finances and getting exposed to the still lingering virus. We’ve already seen a big shift to e-commerce and that’s just going to proliferate more for safety reasons.” Jim Van Horn, a bankruptcy attorney at Barnes & Thornburg who has handled retail restructuring cases, also predicted a wave of bankruptcies. Failing to pay on time is often a precursor to restructuring or bankruptcy. Here’s a list of retailers that are trying to avoid the same fate, based on USA TODAY research, public data and analyst reports:\n\nForever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September with plans to close roughly 100 struggling stores and save the rest of the business.

THE PAST (in brief review)\n\nAs a head nod and thanks to stores like Lord & Taylor, the department store industry had a 100+ year run as one of the most innovative, entrepreneurial industries the world has ever known. Innovations by other department stores are mentioned in this article in Fast Company and include the invention of the price tag, the return policy and the very first fashion shows. The Wall Street Journal article blames the death of department stores in part on fast fashion and off-price retail, as well as on a focus that “became more about how to take care of the corporate office, not the customer,” according to Allen Questrom, former CEO of Neiman Marcus, Barneys New York Inc., J.C. Penney and Federated Department Stores Inc., which became Macy’s Inc.\n\nBut I think this overlooks a significant point of differentiation when you are talking about “taking care of customers.” The company\'s commitment to data prevents inventory problems as it ships five-item ""fixes"" to clients largely based on what the data predict the customer will want. The fact that they haven’t been also begs the question of whether these stores are even offering the right brands, and if you stripped out cosmetics and some handbag assortments, whether they’d even survive at all.

On the call with me today is Seth Ravin, our CEO and Stanley Mbugua, our Chief Accounting Officer. Our quarter-end global employee count was 1,343, a year-over-year increase of 14%. All in all, based on the facts and our analysis, we still believe the opportunities created by the pandemic and slowing global economy far outweigh risks and that our strong balance sheet and cash position will provide us with business flexibility and agility to help prospects and clients with special needs while providing us protection against downside risk. As a result of the measures that we have taken in response to the pandemic, including shifting to nearly 100% remote employee, remote sales and virtual marketing models for fiscal year 2020 we are expecting savings from reduced travel, cancelled in-person marketing events, reduced office operating costs and potential rent rebatements related to office closures around the world. The client had previously moved their large complex SAP software landscape to us and found our service, value and partnership to be excellent. Lastly is a win with one of the largest advertising conglomerates in the world headquartered in Japan. The client has been interested and watching Rimini Street's fast paced growth across Japan with leading companies as well as known brands, and decided it was time to move its vast SAP landscape to Rimini Street support. And our new large complex S/4HANA client, Nadro, headquartered in Mexico. We have been servicing SAP products since 2008 and now providing award winning proven premium support services to hundreds of clients running SAP Business Suite 7, S/4HANA applications and SAP HANA Inside based databases. Further, sales of AMS to existing clients is proving that an integrated Rimini Street support and AMS solution is creating a unique value proposition for the client and demonstrating the new AMS product line strength at a cross sell opportunity. We believe our integrated software support and AMS combined offering is a unique and valuable competitive solution in the market that provides clients with a better model, better resources and better outcomes with higher client satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. With the pandemic and resulting economic challenges, we believe we will see even further extensions of use of the hybrid IT environment. With respect to Oracle versus Rimini Street that was filed in 2010 and went to trial in 2015, the case has run its course of all appeals. Trial is not currently expected to occur until 2022, but could occur earlier or later. Second quarter annualized subscription revenue was $311 million, a year-over-year increase of 12%. The lower year-over-year gross margin reflects our continued investment in an expanded global capacity to deliver new Application Management Services for SAP, Oracle and Salesforce. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, which excludes outside litigation costs, was 16.8% for the second quarter compared to 15.2% for the second quarter of 2019. Lastly, litigation expense was $2.9 million for the second quarter 2020 compared to $144,000 in the prior year second quarter. Our outside litigation spend is not linear and can fluctuate each quarter based on litigation activities. Backlog, which includes the sum of pure deferred revenue and non-cancelable future revenue was approximately $464 million as of June 30, 2020, up 14% from $407 million as of June 30, 2019. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Number one, when you take a look at our invoicing for customers who pay us a year of invoicing in advance, that number was the highest we've ever seen in any quarter. And that's why even in the fourth quarter you remember we picked up a bunch of revenue that had been cleared out and had been ready to recognize. And to your question of whether we had any contingencies, we didn't have many of those that we think will be released. As you think about the pipeline in the second half, obviously you've given revenue guidance and we can back into Q4, but more from a bookings perspective, is that something that's kind of what we normally see, pretty more backend loaded to Q4 or Q3? So a lot of opportunity but much more challenging to get deals done. Execution challenges exist on a global basis and we continue to navigate them. I think you're watching us, as we mentioned even last quarter, we think that the opportunity on top of what was already growing, because you know when we did our initial guidance for 2020, we had already come out of it -- it was really a pre-COVID guidance. And I think that the combination of which gives us good tailwinds for growth. If you haven't been out there, it's a completely new platform. It goes along with our pathing for specific roles that we're selling to. So we're making a lot of big marketing investments to reach out. Well I think as most people know, first he took 12 direct reports from me, which is a great thing. Because the reason they didn't get the contracts done were their internal operations and they figured that it would take them maybe a few more weeks, maybe another month. But it's been an up and coming theater for us and has been leading global expansion for a while. And that makes it really hard to get a lot of deals done there right now. A lot of opportunity in that region as well, but hampered by COVID right now. So I think you're going to continue to see APAC probably lead for a while because things are just easier to get done over there right now. You know I've always talked about learning to walk before we run and I'm very conservative about these big new product introductions. That's one of the reasons gross margin primarily is down is because we've added a lot of bodies into the AMS side that that will continue to suppress gross margin on a blended basis while of course our existing support product continued to imported gross margin as an offset. What we did with our teams was, we laid out, just like everybody else, and I'm sure every other company you're talking to, everyone is beating up their vendors to get them discount in this day and age. Do we need to just give you quarterly to help with cash flow? The other thing we do is we will work to get something in exchange for something. As you know, we have 70% is non-cancelable for at least 12 months. We have added a lot of multiyear agreements in return for some of that help. So I think because of that, just because we take a little bit of hit maybe in the money or some of the cash flow, as you've seen, we're at record cash numbers because we're very diligent on collecting cash and managing cash. Seth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the competition from SAP and Oracle remains fierce. And I think we're doing the right thing in continuing that investment now. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for final remarks.""]",19.1813622330949,

But the small businesses simply can’t survive much of an interruption. Many restaurants are gone and the trends we already were seeing in retail of consumers moving online for certain types of purchases will be accelerated. One question is whether department stores will still be around when this is over,” said Willett. More good news came in May, when the NMHC reported that 1.6 percent more of residents month over month made at least a partial rent payment through May 20. The biggest impact in late payments is being felt in Class C product, likely because that segment of the population has less savings, said Willett. “Any difference in geography is tied to industry composition and places most impacted by COVID-19, like New York, New Orleans and Las Vegas, the latter because it’s the number one hospitality market in the nation, where 28 percent of incomes are derived from the sector,” said Willett. The Trump administration responded to the impact of the virus on the housing industry by halting foreclosures on government-backed mortgages and directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to suspend evictions until the end of April. Most big apartment owners were quick to negotiate these rent deferral and payment plans, but small owners, which make up 95 percent of the nation’s rental industry, are hit especially hard when they do not get rent payments from their tenants in time to pay their own mortgages and other bills. The data that points to consumer optimism in apartment renting is welcome, given the dive that online traffic took in March after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.

Crew and Neiman Marcus filing for bankruptcy, and individuals being laid off en masse in light of non-essential business closures and shelter-in-place mandates. But while many companies are expected to cut down on funds earmarked for sustainability endeavors, the circular economy – an economic system aimed at eliminating waste by extending the lifespan of resources and a key concept in the push towards sustainability – very well may offer part of the solution for lasting recovery. This equates to more than 12 tons per year for every person on the planet. According to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, a circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by design. It is about maintaining economic value in production processes for as long as possible. While the crisis has increased some waste streams in single-use, disposable items, there is growing consensus that the circular economy can support recovery plans in four key areas:\n\nReducing supply-chain risks: One of the consequences of the crisis is that our confidence in global supply-chains has diminished. Nations and businesses will seek to build greater supply-chain resilience by increasing the local purchase of raw materials, many of which can already be found in existing products that have reached the end of their useful life. Generate growth: An increasing number of studies have highlighted the wider macro-economic benefits of the circular economy, which is one of the reasons it is part of the EU’s recovery plan.', ""The clothes piled up in one corner of Brendon Babenzien’s dining room, folded behind the section of the dinner table that had become his workplace—a little retail operation in his apartment. In March, when the coronavirus began forcing huge chunks of the country to work from home, Babenzien—the founder and designer of the streetwear-gone-prep label Noah—took his work home, too. Because, not quite a month after New York City went quiet, the clothing business was on the ropes. And you could only expect loyal customers to buy clothing they didn’t need for only so long, right? I called Babenzien up in April, amidst this swirl of uncertainty, curious about how a brand like his survives when the world caves in. That didn’t mean things would be good; nothing was good, for anyone, anywhere. Noah gives one percent of its annual sales to grassroots environmental groups, and releases one-off goods to support various causes throughout the year. Of course, such enlightened ambitions only raise the stakes when it comes to survival. Because the bigger you are, if you're doing the right thing, probably the more you're contributing to a positive society.” From one angle, Babenzien wasn’t just talking about his own brand, but about an entire generation of them. The industry is still in a period of flux: some brands chase clout, others pursue permanence. Last year, there was enough room for all of them to go their own ways. And whoever survives, in having made it through, will have proven the viability of their business model. We just had to do the things we cared about, and organically you would get Noah, basically.” It was the ‘80s; surfing and skateboarding were growing in popularity, but not yet corporate. By the time he left to reboot Noah in 2015, he was ready to apply the lessons he’d internalized at Rick’s—worry about community, not consumers; care about the environment—to his own work. “ As much as I have a tremendous amount of respect for what people have done, I also recognize that that's not the only way. We were surprised by how quickly that new consumer we thought was developing came around,” Babenzien recalled. “ In five years, they had also formed a remarkably durable customer base. Initially, they’d kept the shop open by appointment, but by that point nobody seemed keen to leave the house; eventually, they went dark, as did every other nonessential business in the city. I feel like we're entering into the phase where, no matter how good of a businessperson you are, how good of a marketer you are, how great your product is, no amount of effort is going to help us do very well,” Babenzien said. The brand is nothing without those things—without surfing and skating and running and music and interest in design and art and literature. When sales projections are lower than usual, the challenge is that much stiffer. If they have to buy it at a discount on some promotion or whatever, and then they become fans of what we're doing, then cool. When Babenzien was a kid, he and his skate-rat buddies would sneak onto construction sites after hours. In early May, video emerged of the murder, months earlier, of Ahmaud Arbery. We would carry stolen wood through neighborhoods where everyone could see us. He concluded by encouraging his white audience to investigate their privilege, and handed the mic to his wife, Estelle. As the country erupted in protest, Babenzien had begun hearing from employees of color dissatisfied with the company’s response. And even if the coronavirus had shortened, in a phrase of Babenzien’s that stuck in my head, “the runway to consumer behavior change”—if it had ensured that more people would be buying fewer things of higher quality sooner than he’d expected—his audience was still limited to the relatively affluent. Noah could fight for progress, but in a smaller pool than Babenzien would have liked. But the pandemic had reminded him how foundational consumption was to contemporary American life."", ""A store stands closed near Wall Street as the coronavirus keeps financial markets and businesses mostly closed on May 08, 2020 in New York City.

But if you take too long to repay those funds, you may miss some recovery gains. If you\'ve already borrowed the maximum from your 401(k), you could access more cash by taking a hardship withdrawal. First, you\'re spending your retirement savings well before retirement.

Your balance goes down immediately and takes your future earnings potential down with it. Tapping your retirement savings can keep you afloat during tough times, but it is a temporary solution.

The report said hiring had already fallen to levels seen during the height of the financial crisis. While economists diverge on the extent of the damage the coronavirus is likely to cause to the economy, given the uncertainty about the fallout from the virus, there is a broad consensus that the lockdowns and other emergency measures in major European economies such as Germany, Italy, France and Spain will drag the region into a recession. Experts say the meltdown could eradicate millions of jobs across the region but the impact on each country would depend on how the individual governments respond to the crisis. Germany\'s ""Kurzarbeit"" or short-time work program allows companies facing economic distress to reduce working hours of their employees instead of firing them. The German government then provides workers with an allowance to partly make up for the lost wages. ""The crisis is causing massive distortions in the labor market that are worse even than conditions at the height of the financial crisis,"" ifo President Clemens Fuest said.

Seven current and former employees from across a range of teams and roles at the company said separately that they all believed the reason behind cutting Sojourn and taking employees off diversity projects to move them elsewhere at Google was to shield the company from backlash from conservatives. “One of the major motivations for cutting Sojourn is that the company doesn’t want to be seen as anti-conservative,” one Google employee familiar with the company’s diversity programming said in an interview. “ Google and the majority of its workforce are based in the U.

High-quality companies\' are the ones with a Quality Score of ""6"" or above. Does Intuit have strong and durable competitive advantages over competitors? But, despite having all sorts of prized skills, he was not much of a programmer. Randomly, while at the campus, he tapped the shoulder of a passing student and asked: ""Excuse me, where would be a good place to post these flyers? Scott Cook has always preached that Intuit wins ""by creating products that function well and feel good to the senses"", and he readily admits that many of the company\'s best ideas were - and still are - produced by its customers. Through its \'Education Program\', Intuit has been doing an outstanding job at nurturing this switching barrier from an early stage. These initiatives create a virtuous cycle that perpetuates the company\'s dominance. Indeed, even with QuickBooks or other similar programs, many business owners still require someone who understands tax and accounting regulations inside-out. Besides, advances in society and technology have made sales, marketing, and accounting more complex than ever. Is Intuit a diversified company, with multiple and complementary sources of revenue? Each business segment offers products optimized for particular customer needs in accounting, individual tax filing, and professional tax preparation. This business accounted for about 52% of the company\'s sales in 2019. ProConnect Tax Online is a cloud-based solution designed for practices that prepare consumer and small business tax returns; this offering integrates with QuickBooks Online. By integrating distinct solutions offered by Intuit itself and by third-party developers, the three business units form a large and synergistic ecosystem unmatched by the firm\'s direct rivals. Intuit benefits from revenue diversity at the product level but not at the geographic level: for better or worse, and since 90%-95% of its revenue comes from the United States, the company\'s faith is closely tied to the faith of the small businesses and self-employed individuals in the country. Xero also enjoyed solid growth in South Africa and Southeast Asia. Sage, the UK\'s incumbent, was also caught off guard and leaked a significant amount of market share to Xero in the online space. Disruption will probably also arrive from outside the accounting software industry: with their millions of small business customers and appetite to enlarge their product portfolios, capable companies like Shopify, Square (SQ), or Wix (WIX) may one day decide to compete head-on against Intuit. Competition from the Public Sector: In aggregate, American taxpayers spend 6-8 billion hours filing their taxes each year; in addition to this immense amount of time, Americans also spend up to 215 billion dollars annually to keep the IRS off their backs. But the IRS could do the taxes of millions of Americans for free if only the political establishment would let it. This helps to explain why open markets tend to become more efficient over time. Recently, a biting government audit found that some 14 million Americans paid for tax preparation services they could have received for free. For how much longer can Intuit maintain the current situation? Either way, considering the heat the company has taken lately, and with or without Free File, Intuit can still be pressured to include previously unavailable premium features in the company\'s free tax-filing offerings; moreover, some proposed forms of tax reform would also impact Intuit\'s ProConnect business. Is Intuit present in attractive markets offering clear growth runways? The expanding digital infrastructure reduced the costs of starting and running a small business, revealed new markets, lowered competitive barriers, and led to the creation of disruptive business models. Businesses that fail to embrace technological change will be under increasing competitive pressure from more savvy competitors. According to Deloitte, relative to businesses that have low levels of digital adoption, more digitally-advanced businesses realize significant benefits. For example, such businesses earned two times as much revenue per employee than late adopters. Notwithstanding its intrinsic attractiveness, the market where Intuit operates also has a few weaknesses. For example, Intuit\'s revenues are both cyclical and seasonal because the total number of returns filed with the IRS fluctuates in tandem with the wider economy and the time of the year; moreover, Intuit\'s customer turnover is not trivial, as the death rates of small businesses are usually high even during good times: according to the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (2018), in the United States only 45%-51% of small businesses survive the five-year mark, and only about one-third survive 10 years or longer. More and better connections with clients will also enable accountants to solve problems preemptively. This, again, should strengthen Intuit\'s ecosystem and generate win-win interactions for all the involved parties.* Then they were hit by an even more ferocious second wave in the fall. Because it lets consumers interact with certified public accountants without leaving their homes - a behavior that fits the demands of a post-pandemic world - this pioneering offering is expected to grab more market share over the next few years and to have a transformative effect on the way many Americans (and especially the \'digital-native\' generations) prepare their taxes. Initially, QuickBooks became one of the most popular enterprise software solutions for SMEs through a combination of reliability, ease-of-use, accessible entry-level price points, and marketing muscle; today, QuickBooks leads the market in the United States, which is still the largest and most profitable market in the world for accounting software. Has Intuit maintained high average Cash Returns On Invested Capital (>15%) over the last 10 years? Other mature software companies that serve individuals and small businesses - like Paychex or Adobe (ADBE) - are also within that highly profitable zone. The other parts that explain Intuit\'s profitability are its extensive scale, the very low incremental costs of providing its mission-critical solutions to SMEs and consumers, and the good capital allocation skills of the management team (however, as mentioned before, the jury is still out regarding Intuit\'s latest acquisitive moves). Now, it remains to be seen if the Credit Karma deal is going to generate the same long-term economic profitability that has made Intuit so attractive to investors in previous years. No competitor even comes close to Intuit in this instance; however, over the medium-term, the current crisis will, of course, harm the company\'s FCF generation. For example, hardware producers or oil and gas corporations must always invest in expensive PP&E that requires periodic repair and replacement; such businesses must also tie up cash in assets like inventory. None of these situations affected Intuit but they certainly affected Sage, a firm that struggled to migrate its customers and services from a standard license model to its cloud platform. However, the company\'s latest quarter results offered a glimpse of what the future might bring: compared to the year-ago quarter, third quarter 2020 revenues declined by 8.25% due both to the negative effects of the lockdown on small businesses and to the extension of the tax filing deadline in the US (the extension of the deadline is a temporary issue, of course; either way, due to the high levels of unemployment, Intuit won\'t be able to recoup all its lost revenue). Can Intuit cover payments on its outstanding corporate debt without difficulty? Intuit\'s interest coverage ratio stands at an impressive 158.5. For the time being, though, Intuit seems to be in good financial shape. Is Intuit highly productive and profitable relative to its assets? Yes: 1 Point\n\nAsset productivity is a key contributor to shareholder value. Being so, how productive is Intuit relative to its total assets? There\'s no hard-and-fast rule to analyze a given company along this dimension but the calculation should be made both with and without goodwill just to make sure the firm is not overpaying for unproductive acquisitions over time; in Intuit\'s case, goodwill has been responsible for about 28% of the company\'s total assets throughout the last decade, showing that Intuit has been moderately acquisitive. In fact, along this specific dimension, Intuit is one of the most productive large-cap companies in the world. Pricing power is one of the main attributes of a strong business. Judging by the prices it has been able to charge over the years, Intuit surely seems to be one of those strong businesses. This assertion is confirmed by Intuit\'s small competitor ZipBooks, for example, when it stated that the company\'s ""many customers feel like price changes happen often. Of course, Intuit can drive its prices and profits upward as long as the cost to the customer does not exceed the cost of switching to a competing provider. As shown below, Intuit is the company with higher average operating margin among its peer group. Still, because Intuit seems to be reinforcing its switching barriers and positive network externalities, retention of existing (and surviving) customers should likely improve over the next 5 years. As a consequence of all these factors, the model assumes high revenue volatility translated into negative sales growth of - 10% in 2020-2021, a reacceleration of revenues to 2%-6% in 2022-2023, and finally, a further reacceleration to 8%-12% in 2024. This, in turn, should lead to operating margins of 27%-28% by 2024. Cost of Capital, Terminal Growth Rate, and Fair Value Estimate: The DCF model assumes a WACC within the 6.5% + [± 1.5%] range. Making it one of the highest-quality mature companies within the tech sector, the Quality Score for Intuit is 8 out of 11 possible points.

Iconic department stores such as Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor have declared bankruptcy. Creative business models that once seemed niche and not exactly scalable are now a much more promising lifeline for the fashion industry. Nonoo began her career in 2011 as a runway designer who manufactured clothes the traditional way, placing bets on which items in her collection would be popular, then placing large orders at factories. Startups such as Ministry of Supply and Rapha make a few pieces of their collection on 3D printing machines after a customer places an order, while Adidas and Zara are just beginning to experiment with on-demand technology. Instead, she only designs core pieces that are versatile and classic. These items will be sold for years and will only be retired when there is no longer any demand for them. And while the model is ultimately more lucrative for Nonoo, because there is no waste, it’s true that the cost per item is higher than making pieces at scale. “ It was a heavy lift, and I think this is why so many brands are reticent to do it.” For fast-fashion brands, making products on demand might be appealing because it will allow them to rapidly respond to the latest trends while avoiding wasted inventory and markdowns.

An Industry Where Waste Is Baked In\n\nMaking clothes on demand is relatively rare in the fashion industry, although there has been growing interest in the approach over the past couple of years. McKinsey’s 2019 State of Fashion report predicted that made-to-order production would become mainstream in the fashion industry by 2025, because it would allow brands to reduce their overstock and allow them to more quickly adapt to consumer demand. They then sell as much as they can at full price, before discounting the rest or selling it to outlets. As a runway designer, she sold her collections through department stores and discovered that selling 75% of the garments she produced was considered a great success. Instead, she only designs core pieces that are versatile and classic. She might commit to purchasing 300 cashmere sweaters from the Peruvian factory, which will each be made on demand. If more orders come in, the factory stands to make more money; if fewer orders come in, Nonoo will compensate them anyway. Nonoo believes that her approach is more relevant to the fashion industry than ever, but she also recognizes that it is very hard to fundamentally rewire your supply chain. It was a heavy lift, and I think this is why so many brands are reticent to do it.” But they were also responsible for the churn in the fashion industry, demanding new looks every season to give customers a reason to come into the store.

But one thing is now clear: Those decisions, made between 3:20 and 8:08 p.m. on a single late-summer day, amounted to four criminal fraud charges and the apparent end of a brilliant Wall Street career. Kamensky, the government alleged in its complaint, tried to use his position as a member of that committee and as a client of Wall Street investment bank Jefferies to keep the bank from making a rival offer for shares of a Neiman Marcus entity that Marble Ridge — which held Neiman Marcus bonds and term loans — wanted to buy. I was shocked beyond belief, extremely upset; I am still now. At the time that he joined Paulson, he was at the top of the investing world. Not that I ever thought that he was the kind of guy who was going to break the law, but he was a bulldog, like other players in the distressed space. “I like Dan; I think he’s a smart guy,” says someone else who has worked with him on bankruptcy and restructuring situations. “ He can be a pain in the ass in terms of being demanding and aggressive, but with me he was utterly and always respectful. Then, in May 2020, Neiman Marcus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., Geller called the unsecured creditors’ committee’s financial adviser, turnaround veteran Mohsin Meghji, and told him Jefferies wanted to make an offer for the shares “in the 30s” — substantially higher than the offer that Marble Ridge had submitted. Meghji and Richard Pachulski, the committee’s lawyer, then decided they needed to halt work on finalizing the Marble Ridge proposal — and that they needed to tell Kamensky why. ( Pachulski later said he did not remember being told that Jefferies wanted the bid to be confidential.) They called Kamensky at 3:15 to tell him about the Jefferies offer. He believed Jefferies’ offer “was not serious and nothing would come of it; he stated that Jefferies was likely just fishing for information.” At 3:20, Kamensky sent an urgent Bloomberg chat to Femenia. “ Seventeen minutes later, Kamensky got on the phone with Femenia and Geller. In his mind, he was going to have the MyTheresa shares come hell or high water; all the Jefferies bid would do is drive up his final price. Kamensky later recalled in the Trustee interview that Femenia had then asked him why he was so angry. They explained that he was an important client and that they intended to withdraw from making any bid for the shares. On that call, the committee members decided to reach out to Marble Ridge’s general counsel, to find out if what Jefferies had told them was accurate. At 7:30 p.m. the attorney called Pachulski and other members of the committee and said that Kamensky had contacted Jefferies about the bid, but claimed that there was “a misunderstanding about his intention.” Maybe you can see your way to saying that it was misconstrued . . . For some committee members this may run headlong into their own interests. Kamensky, a bankruptcy lawyer by training, certainly knew this. He was afraid that any potential Jefferies bid would disrupt the process of including a cash-out proposal in a plan that the committee had to file to the court by August 3, which he believed was a firm deadline. People who knew Kamensky may hold differing views about his approach — but until the Jefferies saga, he had a reputation for being a smart investor, a devoted family man, and a philanthropist who gave generously to Jewish causes. But no one knows whether creditors were actually harmed by that. As for Kamensky, he faces several years in prison, as well as civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The retail giant often tops the rankings in customer service surveys. Jamie Nordstrom, the president of Nordstrom, often attributes the company's success to improving customer service. One of the best ways to do this is to empower employees by giving them sufficient freedom and trust. E-Commerce and Online Shopping (and the COVID-19 Pandemic)\n\nNordstrom's decades of competitive advantage in the luxury retail industry are often attributed to its high-end mall-based department stores. However, trends in the modern world have encouraged retailers to shift businesses online and Nordstrom is doing likewise. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of diversification away from traditional retail and accelerated the company's focus away from high-end, in-store shopping. Delving into F&B not only provides opportunities for diversification but enhances the shopping experience for customers. These inventory-free stores is indeed a differentiator, keeping department stores relevant. As discussed, Nordstrom chooses to pursue different types of competitive advantages and has applied them effectively. Despite being poised as a luxury, high-end retailer, Nordstrom employs cost leadership strategy well through its Nordstrom Rack subsidiary and six sales events annually. • Macy's, an American department store that share many similarities and often compared to Nordstrom for their retail shopping experience\n• Kohl's, the largest department store chain in USA at the time of writing."", 'Working-from-home has become the “new normal” for many, but what happens when those who used to work in an office are asked to return to their 9-to-5?

Not only do we have business continuity, we now have the best balance sheet in the business. Now the company wants to put this year behind it and forge ahead. Its future depends on whether or not it can win back the trust of its brand partners, who have been burned during the process. In April, the company shared what was selling during the pandemic with brand partners, and the brands were able to react quickly, to get better-placed products in stores by the August delivery, says Van Raemdonck. “Neiman will have to prove that it’s back on stable footing and re-establish very strong relationships with brands — even stronger than they have already done — just to instill confidence,” Saunders says. “ We’re very focused on being present for the customer, however and whenever they want,” he says.

For every A-plus mall, they probably got five ones that are crap.” The Indianapolis-based REIT kicked off the year on a high note. “It’s almost the most inopportune time to be executing a larger public retail merger,” St. Juste said. “ The decision to buy more malls this year, even last year, is a head-scratcher. Simon remained mum about the status of the Taubman deal during its first-quarter earnings call but all that changed the next month when it announced it would scrap the acquisition, citing fallout from the pandemic. Sparc later picked up Nautica and in February bought Forever 21 for $81 million. But the coronavirus pandemic kicked Simon’s retail acquisitions into high gear. Sparc bought jean purveyor Lucky Brand for $140 million and iconic menswear retailer Brooks Brothers for $325 million. With Simon’s large war chest, the acquisitions generally don’t strain its balance sheet either. Clearly you wouldn’t be buying out these tenants if you didn’t have to. And the more these investments increase, the more worries investors have about them. Simon also lost about $215 million after giving rent abatements to tenants, but it isn’t sitting idly by while tenants don’t pay up. To deal with the potential of large swaths of empty stores, Simon has turned to an unlikely savior, Amazon. Similar companies that have opened fulfillment centers in malls do it on a much smaller scale, only taking 2,000 to 10,000 square feet, and require less equipment, trucks and workers than a traditional Amazon warehouse does. Some also offer existing tenants the ability to use their services. Yet the Amazon deal could be another life preserver to help Simon ride out the pandemic and it’s got plenty of reasons to be confident it will come out on the other side. Woodbury Common in Orange County, N.Y., also owned by Simon, only had a 25.9 percent decrease in foot traffic from August 2019 to August 2020 and for the week ending on Sept. 7 actually saw an increase of 28.9 percent year over year, Placer.ai’s data shows.

More than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April as the outbreak brought normal business to a screeching halt.

Yet during the first half of this year, RBC Wealth Management, managing $414 billion in client assets and more than 2,000 advisors, has been among the big winners in the recruitment wars among all traditional brokerage firms. Once the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March, RBC—like every other wealth management firm—pivoted to a digital process with online meetings and digital “tours” of the home office. But by April, RBC announced it recruited a team in Fond du Lac, Wisc. that managed $688 million at Wells Fargo and another Merrill team that managed $472 million. RBC isn’t sharing exact figures, but Discovery Data, a database that tracks financial advisors and intermediaries, reported the firm pulled in a net gain of 58 advisors in the first half of the year, 39 between April and June, topping Discovery Data’s list for traditional brokerages during that time period. Stifel, Nicolaus & Company had a net gain of 27 advisors between April and June.

Yelp provides information through online communities on restaurants, shopping, nightlife, financial, health and other services. This increase was driven by growth in the number of paying advertising locations. Paying advertising locations grew 6% year over year to 562K sites in the first quarter, mainly on continued improvements in Local customer retention through the end of February. Cumulative reviews climbed 14.3% year over year to 210.8 million. Costs flared up on higher advertising fulfillment costs and elevated website infrastructure expense. Elevated employee costs, higher commissions, and an increase in provision for doubtful accounts mainly escalated costs and expenses. As a result of higher costs and expenses, Yelp’s first-quarter adjusted EBITDA plunged 57% year over year to $17 million. Net cash flow from operating activities was $41 million compared with the previous quarter’s $56 million.']",82.28844139091362,

Unemployment has surged, consumer confidence has dropped, some companies have closed their doors, and it remains to be seen if the federal government\'s pump-priming efforts will stoke inflation or a serious debt problem down the road. But many Arizona-based companies, and their stock prices, aren\'t feeling much pain. Carvana has combined convenience (vehicles are purchased online) with guarantees (there\'s a seven-day return policy) and gimmicks (its vehicle vending machine is located near Loop 202 on Scottsdale Road) to carve out a growing market share in the highly fragmented used-car business. Sales came in below Wall Street expectations, the Wedbush analysts said. Carvana isn\'t yet profitable — its loss for the first half of 2020 more than doubled to $101 million — but investors are looking past the red ink and focusing instead on rising vehicle sales and market expansion. The year did not start out well for Freeport-McMoRan, the Phoenix-based copper mining giant. But as quickly as they sank, copper prices rebounded, helped by an economic revival in China, unusually low inventories and the high capital costs needed to open new mines. ""This recovery came sooner and stronger than we and others anticipated,"" said Richard Adkerson, Freeport\'s CEO, in a conference call with Wall Street analysts. He described low copper inventories as a good omen, along with increased use of the metal in electric vehicles and in alternative-energy generating sources. Freeport also produces gold, which has benefited from investor unease about future economic stability and the potential for rising inflation. But the company\'s fortunes are mainly tied to copper, with sales of that metal roughly six times those of gold. The need to eat\n\nGrocery stores have flourished amid the coronavirus crisis.

While the future success of these new programs is unknown, the scramble to preserve these mostly small businesses is of the utmost importance in retaining the spirit of the Bay. Whether a small mom-and-pop business or a polarizing restaurant chain, denizens miss their places of gathering. We asked a few locals what shuttered businesses they will miss the most and why. Owners Jesse and Roberta Fink put the 38-year-old dessert café up for sale in early June. The shop signs outside declaring “Awesome Hot Cakes” and “Voted Best Burger” never seemed to change. Next to Grooves Inspiralled Vinyl and across the street from the SF LGBT Center, It’s Tops and its surrounding businesses symbolized the old, new, and all very San Francisco history. The institution has garnered support from San Francisco politicians for decades as well. Local ice cream lovers were shocked when the ubiquitous Three Twins Ice Cream announced in mid-April that it would cease operations. Gottlieb started Three Twins as a single retail shop in 2005, with the vision of offering an organic ice cream that was affordable and gave to environmental conservation efforts. The company rapidly expanded to several retail shops, farmers market residencies, and grocery store freezer shelves. It’s a last-ditch but sincere effort to continue supporting staff as they figure out next steps in an entire industry that’s unsure of its future.

It was just a few years ago that she opened a retail location near Lake Merritt, offering flavorful takes such as grapefruit custard and yam-ginger-beet.

Joey Gollish (Mr. Saturday): I don’t necessarily think it’s going to result in a shrinking of the market, at least on the customer’s side, but I do think we’re going to see a tightening up as far as brands that are able to participate.

These darkened windows now serve as reminders that too many retailers spent too much time looking within, when they should have been acting on what was happening outside. Here are five signs of retailers that may be dying, yet may not know it. Adding restaurants and salon services in the department store (as some have done) may help bring shoppers in, but if the merchandise doesn’t hold up to the competition, they just serve as expensive window dressing. Not all retailers share sales-per-customer data, but there are hints when it is on the decline, such as reduced foot traffic (as evidenced at Pier 1) and steep discounts. Tired, unsmiling or stressed workers spread feelings of dissatisfaction, while workers who are well-trained and -recognized fight for their companies. Early symptoms of J.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, companies both large and small are looking for ways to weather the storm. Kellogg’s succeeded by going heavy into radio advertising, launching ads that featured its now-famous “Snap! In order to create more jobs, the cereal manufacturer shifted to a 6-hour work day, giving workers a 12.5% raise in hourly wages while reducing working hours by 25%. On the advertising front, Kellogg’s crisis strategy was successful because, at a time when other companies were making cuts, its increased advertising spend allowed its cereal brands to gain a greater share of consumer attention. Things only got worse after 9/11 and the industry-wide downturn that followed. In addition to growing Priceline’s supply, the acquisitions allowed the company to take advantage of a new market. Whereas the company’s initial plans to move into unrelated spaces like gasoline and mortgages failed, its move into hotels was a hit. Today, even as the Covid-19 crisis has caused a significant drop in the company’s stock price, Booking Holdings is valued at a market capitalization of around $60B.\n\nSequoia Capital thrived during the Great Recession by turning its attention to focused, disciplined domestic companies, as well as to China. But while Sequoia encouraged its portfolio companies to tighten their belts, the VC itself survived the crisis by continuing to make investments. The VC firm participated in every funding round for Meituan Dianping beginning in 2011. By the time Meituan went public in 2018, the $400M that Sequoia had invested was worth $4.9B, making it one of the best bets in VC history. While the company didn’t go out of business like other internet retailers, including Pets.com and Webvan, Amazon did lose a whopping 90% of its stock value between late 1999 and late 2001. One major reason that Amazon was able to hold on was that it had raised a large amount of money right before the market crashed, giving it the funding it needed to continue operations. The combination of this cash flow strategy and its existing investor capital allowed Amazon to continue gaining market share even with negative profits. By the time the dot-com crisis ended, Amazon had successfully outlasted other online retail competitors, and its innovative new B2B revenue streams helped grow the company into the e-commerce giant it is today. Hostess paired these advancements with a staggeringly successful public relations blitz after Twinkies returned to shelves in July 2013. The media buzz helped drive sales so high that some retailers decided not to charge the slotting fee they usually applied for brands to appear on their shelves. With a longer shelf life, Hostess could sell more Twinkies, and with better logistics, it cost the company less to make them. For General Motors, the late-2000s recession was the straw that broke the camel’s back, pushing the struggling company into a much-publicized bankruptcy. Though GM’s comeback was temporarily interrupted by a $4B ignition switch failure in 2014, its rebound continued under the leadership of Mary Barra, a longtime employee who became the company’s first female CEO at the end of 2013. Barra has worked to institute a culture of accountability that brings together GM’s previously siloed leadership in a more agile, collaborative effort. Finally, the company cut into its fuel costs by hiring crude oil traders and purchasing its own oil refinery and transport ship. Better trained, happier employees made better crew members, which has led to more satisfied, more loyal customers.']",27.07936791884938,

That could be about to change as the $150 bn IT services sector gets on the bandwagon. Mohandas Pai, former board member and HR head of Infosys told TechCircle that if the demand situation worsens in the interim, Indian IT services firms are also likely to let go of employees, contrary to the companies’ assurances. During the March quarter results announcement, the country’s largest software exporter Mumbai based TCS, which does not give out official earnings guidance, said that it was expecting a rebound in demand during the second half of the current financial year. Enterprise responses and reactions hence should also be expected to have a tinge of uncertainty and element of surprise. According to V Balakrishnan, former CFO of Infosys, most IT companies have been doing cost optimisation and have been successful in doing so over the last few years. If revenue growth goes negative or flat, then cutting employees' costs becomes inevitable as it is the only tangible leverage the companies have in further reducing cost structure, he said. “Some enterprises might still approach it as an opportunity for excess load shedding (of the bottom 10%), which they believe can be easily brought back any time later.

In May, employers added 2.5 million jobs, an unexpected increase that suggested that the job market has bottomed out. Building materials stores enjoyed a monthly gain of 10.9% last month and annualized growth of 16.4%. Grocers have posed a 14.4% annual sales increase, reflecting fewer people eating out at restaurants because of the pandemic. Other sectors in retail posted spectacular growth in May yet still face an uncertain future given the blows they absorbed in March and April. Some national chains, by contrast, say they have so far avoided their worst fears. But analysts caution that some of the gains thus far probably reflect the impact of temporary government aid and expanded unemployment benefits in the face of a deep recession. That compares with their combined profit of $8.9 billion in the year-ago period. Far better off were essential retailers, including dollar chains, discounters and food stores. That’s up from the firm’s previous estimate in mid-March of 15,000 closings, and it would surpass the record 9,000 stores closures last year.', 'This article was co-authored with Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global\n\nAs the Covid-19 death toll has raced past 100,000 in the US, and unemployment reached 40 million, you would expect stock markets to be in freefall. In Germany, cases tripled in 24 hours a week after schools and shops started to reopen, putting pressure on the government to resume lockdown restrictions. But most vaccine trials will flop so it is very risky to bet on a narrow set of healthcare stocks. Before the crisis, mid-cap companies had gorged on debt from so-called business development corporations (BDCs)—in effect, shadow banks—racking up debt levels not seen since the internet bubble in the late 1990s/ early 2000s. Post-Covid, many mid-cap firms in these sectors will fold as they are shut out from credit markets. For example, professional services firms may fare better because they can reduce their real estate footprint more easily than industrial companies. They have become even cheaper as credit has tightened even further. Nevertheless, within this segment there are companies which the market is pricing cheaply but are in fact highly valuable. Not surprisingly, many of these are in the biotech space, such as AMAG Pharmaceuticals and Medigene. And all purchases can be made online, phone call or via Facebook.', 'The parent company of two clothing retailers in Pasadena could be the next major American retailer to file for bankruptcy, a CNN Business report said Sunday. The clothing sector of retail has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus crisis, with consumer demand for new clothes falling sharply. The CNN Business report said another company that faces bankruptcy is Ascena Retail Group, which owns the Justice, Lane Bryant, Dress Barn and Catherines’ clothing store brands. Tailored Brands suspended rent payments for April and May when most of its locations were shut, saying it has been able to negotiate rent deferrals for a significant number of its stores, with repayments beginning at the end of 2020 into 2021.', 'The coronavirus pandemic has caused turmoil throughout the retail industry.

Sales decreased by 10.1% in the first quarter compared to 2019. JCPenney will permanently close 154 stores after filing for bankruptcy. Kohl’s reported a 43.5% decrease in sales for the fiscal quarter ending May 2, compared to 2019. The company temporarily closed its stores in March, but as of June 5, about 80% reopened. There are currently no plans for Neiman Marcus to permanently close stores, but the company “will continue to assess store closure decisions.” Home decor retailer Pier 1 Imports announced it has received approval from bankruptcy court to shutter and liquidate all of its roughly 540 stores, including its e-commerce operations. Signet Jewelers, the parent company of the brands Kay Jewelers, Piercing Pagoda and Zales, revealed in an earnings call that about 380 U.S. and Europe stores will permanently close. Brick-and-mortar sales declined by 44.7% due to the pandemic and the closures are an “overall evaluation of our go-forward physical footprint,"" according to CFO Joan Holstein Hilson. L Brands, its parent company, said it’s “closely evaluating all locations, especially more vulnerable centers for risk of closure."" The closings will be “stores at the end of their useful life” and “whose sales can be recovered in nearby stores and online,"" the company said. Inditex said online sales surged amid the coronavirus pandemic, including a 95% increase in April.', 'Come July, businesses that are already struggling to survive amid the fallout of the pandemic and current unrest could receive a knockout blow. Over 20 jurisdictions — including Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, D.C. — are scheduled to raise the minimum wage and strain already tight operating budgets with additional payroll costs. Even during a good economy, the consequences of raising the minimum wage is well-documented. That scenario likely represents a best-case scenario; it’s contingent on a healthy economy. A handful of jurisdictions have acknowledged the harm raising the minimum wage will have on businesses and their employees amid the pandemic. It’s time for more states and locales to follow: They need to postpone summer minimum-wage increases until businesses have a fighting chance to survive. • Richard Berman is the president of Berman and Co., a public relations firm in Washington, D.C.', ""US shoppers returned with vigor in May in partial rebound\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — American shoppers ramped up their spending on store purchases by a record 17.7% from April to May, delivering a dose of energy for retailers that have been reeling since the coronavirus shut down businesses, flattened the economy and paralyzed consumers during the previous two months.

When consumers do make purchases at physical stores, they're increasingly doing so for such items as buildings materials and groceries. Building materials stores posted a monthly gain of 11% last month and year-over-year growth of 16%. Shoppers have increased their grocery purchases by an annual 14%, with fewer of them dining at restaurants because of the pandemic.

The current one began as a healthcare emergency and has rapidly morphed into a financial shock, but its legacy will perhaps be the most profound in the real estate market. The implications of social distancing and hygiene measures to contain the virus were almost immediately apparent to investors: the largest US retail real estate investment trust (Reit), the Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group, lost 68% of its share price value between Feb 21 ($142.25) and March 18 ($44.92). The $100 billion Reit has more than 22.4 million square metres of gross leasable area in North America and Asia. Open-air malls are likely to fare better than enclosed ones, as are malls that have large grocery anchor tenants. It is not only Reit investors that are watching the situation with growing concern.

Jen Blackhurst, professor of business analytics at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business, said the need to shorten lead times by moving production closer to the United States was in discussion before the pandemic. The custom bags are made closer to home (San Francisco) and the off-the-rack bags, which are fairly standard, are manufactured in China.

Still, a big unknown is whether early gains in job growth, retail sales and other areas can be sustained in the coming months or whether they may plateau at a low level. Americans’ retail purchases would need to surge by an additional 9% to return to their level before the pandemic. Any sustained recovery, though, will hinge on an array of factors: The path of the coronavirus, how willing people are to shop, travel and congregate in groups, how many businesses manage to stay open and rehire many workers and whether the government provides additional support. Extending an ongoing shift in shopping habits, Americans last month stepped up their purchases at non-store retailers, which include internet companies like Amazon and eBay, by 9% after boosting such purchases nearly 10% in April. Clothing purchases soared 188% from April to May but remain down 63% over the past 12 months. Some national chains, by contrast, say they have so far avoided their worst fears.

Slammed by the now-ending economic and social lockdown, a growing number of enterprises are filing for bankruptcy or closing up shop because they can’t pay the bills. The upheaval will act as a drag on growth as highly-leveraged companies are forced to divert resources from expanding their businesses to meeting creditor obligations. Big-box retailers Walmart and Costco Wholesale also could come out ahead. Even before the crisis, many economists were becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of corporate leviathans that dominate industries and stifle competition. Overall, the market share held by the top players has increased in more than 75% of U.S. industries during the past two decades, according to a 2018 paper by Rice University Professor Gustavo Grullon and fellow researchers. That’s what happened in April, as the shutdown of some meatpacking plants hit by the coronavirus threatened the nation’s food supply, forcing President Donald Trump to invoke emergency powers to open them up. Recessions historically lead to market consolidation as financially weaker firms are forced out of business. It’s not only the impact of Covid-19, which is of course the primary reason, but also the enormous amount of debt that had been building up in the economy prior to it,” said Altman, who developed a widely used method called the Altman-Z-Score for predicting business failures. Market concentration should increase significantly, which undermines workers’ ability to negotiate their wages, as big companies with access to capital markets take over from the small independent shops that are getting wiped out,” said Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School.

It runs outside their street through copper and fiber-optic cables. Alexis was laid off from his job as an audio engineer two months ago. Unlike in other wealthy nations, the federal government has imposed no cost controls to make broadband more affordable. Even if you account for income, people of color are disproportionately impacted negatively. Those without it either didn’t or had to go to extreme lengths just to try. Here, in the country that invented the internet, every child should have the chance to get online, and they’ll get that chance when I’m president.” In South Korea, home to some of the fastest internet connections on the planet, the government has invested in widespread public broadband networks, which residents enjoy for prices that are, on average, about half what they are in the U. S.\n\nThe U.S. approach hasn’t really worked. Fewer Americans are connected to broadband than the residents of other less-developed countries. Under Trump, the FCC quickly reversed the net neutrality decision and has proven hostile toward programs aimed at helping poor people get online. And Sohn, the former FCC staffer, calculated that the number of participants in the program has dropped by more than 40% since Trump took office. The FCC had an opportunity to step in and address the lack of access just as the pandemic was unfolding. “We have to administer the statute and words written by Congress,” Carr, who previously served as the FCC’s general counsel, wrote in an email. The lightest shade of sky blue represents one provider per tract; a midnight blue means a census tract is served by 12 or more companies. You’re just sitting and waiting and watching, and then you watch another minute and then it stops and it’s very stuttery – my daughter likes to say ’zigging out.’ ” There’s a simple reason for the discrepancy between the internet service the FCC claims the Tyrees can get and what they actually get: The FCC’s data isn’t even close to being accurate. But a company can claim it is serving an area if only one home in that census tract is being served. But for the last decade, this lack of good data has plagued the government’s effort to build broadband infrastructure by limiting its ability to judge how well internet service providers that receive government grants are performing. Consequently, 10 years later, nobody really knows how many people in America lack a broadband connection. In April, having also failed to meet deadlines and facing mountains of debt, Frontier Communications declared bankruptcy.', 'The Coronavirus Laid Bare Our Empty Lip Service To Fixing The \'Digital Divide\'\n\nFCC boss Ajit Pai likes to repeatedly proclaim that one of his top priorities while chair of the FCC is to ""close the digital divide."" In the wake of COVID-19 quarantines, more attention than ever has been given to the fact that upwards of 41 million Americans (double official FCC estimates) still can\'t get any type of broadband despite thirty years of subsidization and lip service toward fixing the nation\'s ""digital divide."" It\'s just more obvious now that citizens in countless COVID-19 hotspots are forced to actually pay attention to it. As in, we literally do not know where broadband is available in the United States or at what speeds and price points it\'s offered. And when ISPs are caught time, and time, and time again taking taxpayer subsidies for services only half deployed (if you\'re lucky), our feckless regulators don\'t genuinely do much about it:\n\n""The last time the FCC handed out money to build internet infrastructure, in 2015, Frontier Communications and CenturyLink, two of the country’s largest internet service providers, collectively won grants worth $3.2 billion over the next four years – more than $800 million a year between them and more than a third of the program’s $9 billion total.']",34.68882753712544,
